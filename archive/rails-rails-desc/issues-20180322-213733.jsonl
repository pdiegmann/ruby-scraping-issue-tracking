{"reactions": {}, "text": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSetup `ActiveStorage` with Google Cloud Storage service:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# storage.yaml\r\ngoogle:\r\n  service: GCS\r\n  credentials: <%= ENV['GCS_CREDENTIALS'] %>\r\n  project: \"my-project-id\"\r\n  bucket: \"my-bucket-name\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass MyModel < ApplicationRecord\r\n    has_one_attached :image\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe `Cache-Control` header for the uploaded file should be set to a sensible and configurable default. Otherwise, on Google Cloud Storage, the default is particularly problematic (`private,max-age=0`). There is currently no way to set the default on Google Cloud side, making the problem particularly annoying compared to other storage backends.\r\n\r\nIdeally, `ActiveStorage` could read a global default in the `storage.yml` file, maybe with a way to override it for specific cases. Something like:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n# Global default on storage.yml\r\ngoogle:\r\n  service: GCS\r\n  credentials: <%= ENV['GCS_CREDENTIALS'] %>\r\n  project: \"my-project-id\"\r\n  bucket: \"my-bucket-name\"\r\n  object_defaults:\r\n    cache-control: \"public, max-age=3600\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nNo `Cache-Control` header is set, causing Google Cloud Storage to default to `Cache-Control: private,max-age=0`. This causes files to never be cached by the browser, which can easily become very problematic on pages showing many uploaded files. There is currently no way on Google Cloud Storage to set a default cache control for the whole bucket, therefore the only reasonable way seems to be to set the cache control upon file upload.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: `5.2.0-rc2`\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: `2.5.0`\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32325, "updated_at": "2018-03-22 20:33:46", "user": 225441, "closed_at": "None", "id": 307804243, "title": "ActiveStorage: No Cache-Control header set on GCS, defaulting to \"private,max-age=0\"", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32325", "created_at": "2018-03-22 20:33:46", "comments": [], "assignees": [], "state": "open", "is-pull-request": false}

{"reactions": {"+1": [5573816]}, "text": "### Summary\r\n\r\nAdd ActiveModel::Error, handling the rendering of messages and access of error's details.\r\nUtilize this class in ActiveModel::Errors, changing it from a hash based interface, to an array of Error objects.\r\n\r\n### Introduction\r\n\r\nActiveModel#errors interface is currently not very object oriented. For some complex use cases, this design made it a bit tedious to use. I feel these issues can be remedied by encapsulating each individual error as an object.\r\n\r\nLast year I implemented AdequateErrors gem to do this, and it solved many of my problems. I later found out that back in 2016, @eprothro suggested the [same idea too](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rubyonrails-core/dRxdSeV4JQE) on the core mailinglist, and Rafael was positive about this. So I made this PR.\r\n\r\nThis interface is by no means final. I don’t know how much change the core team is happy to accept. I do try to find a balance between new flexibility and breaking less stuff. I have also considered many other interfaces, so please discuss and I am happy to change or explain my design rationales.\r\n\r\nWhat’s Rails’ deprecation policy like? As this contains breaking changes, can this go straight into Rails 6.0? Or is some kind of transitioning deprecation needed?\r\n\r\nI will fix other specs/add doc/performance tuning once interface is finalized.\r\n\r\nHere are some benefits of the OO approach:\r\n\r\n#### More flexible query interface such as `where`\r\n\r\nIt’s easy to query one particular object using the `where` clause.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodel.errors.where(:name, :foo, bar: 3).first\r\n```\r\n\r\n`delete`, `add`, `added?`, `where` all share the same method signature (attribute, type, options). So we are able to delete specific errors now:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodel.errors.delete(:name, :too_powerful, level: 9000)\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Testing is more precise and flexible\r\n\r\nWe can now test if “foo” error exists, regardless of its options hash.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodel.errors.add(:name, :too_powerful, level: 9000)\r\n\r\nmodel.errors.added?(:name, :too_powerful, level: 9000) # returns true\r\nmodel.errors.added?(:name, :too_powerful) # will be false in the past, but be true now.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn the past, added? works by re-render the message and compare it against current message. Therefore if level is not provided, it will return false. In the PR, `added?` only compare Error's attributes against what's provided, so it can be more general or more specific depending on the needs.\r\n\r\n#### Get message of corresponding details of one particular error\r\n\r\nIf you saw that name attribute has two `foo_error` and one `bar_error`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# model.errors.details\r\n{:name=>[{error: :foo_error, count: 1}, {error: :bar_error}, {error: :foo_error, count: 3}]}\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow do you back track the message on the third particular error? With the current implementation, we have to resort to using array indexes:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nmodel.errors.messages[:name][2]\r\n```\r\n\r\nOr we can call `generate_message` to recreate a message from the details, but that's also tedious.\r\n\r\nWith OO, we won't have this problem. Error is represented as an object, message and details are its attributes, so accessing those are straightforward:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ne = model.errors.where(:name, :foo_error).last\r\ne.full_message\r\ne.options # similar to details, where meta informations such as `:count` is stored.\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Lazily evaluating message for internationalization\r\n\r\n[@morgoth](https://github.com/morgoth) mentioned this issue that when you're adding error, it's translated right away.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\n# actual:\r\nI18n.with_locale(:pl) { user.error.full_messages } # => outputs EN errors always\r\n\r\n# expecting:\r\nI18n.with_locale(:pl) { user.error.full_messages } # => outputs PL errors\r\nI18n.with_locale(:pt) { user.error.full_messages } # => outputs PT errors\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR addresses this by lazily evaluating messages only when `message` is called.\r\n\r\n#### Opens possibility to advanced modding\r\n\r\nOnce errors are objects, it’s easy to add functionality on top of them. We can have custom methods to disable global attribute prefix on error’s full messages.\r\n\r\n### List of API changes\r\n\r\n`[]`, `as_json`, `blank?`, `clear`, `count`, `empty?`\r\nunchanged\r\n\r\n`add`\r\nunchanged\r\n\r\n`added?`\r\nmostly unchanged, for the one change see \"Testing is more precise and flexible\"\r\n\r\n`delete`\r\nextended, so we can give more specific condition such as error type or options.\r\n\r\n`each`\r\nNow enumerable of the Error array\r\n\r\n`full_message`\r\nremoved as it is no longer needed.\r\nunchanged ~~Full message is generated in Error.~~\r\n\r\n`full_messages`, `full_messages_for`\r\nunchanged\r\n\r\n`generate_message`\r\nunchanged ~~Moved to Error as message is generated there.~~\r\n\r\n`has_key?` `key?`, `keys`\r\nunchanged ~~Removed as I thought this is no longer a hash.~~\r\n\r\n`include?`, `size`, `to_hash`, `to_xml`, `to_a`\r\nunchanged\r\n\r\n`values` \r\nunchanged ~~removed as it has little value.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Add a prefix option to ActiveRecord::Store.store_accessor and\r\nActiveRecord::Store.store. This option allows stores to have identical keys\r\nwith different accessors.\r\n\r\n### Summary\r\n\r\nI often bump into problems at work when using ActiveRecord::Store because of name collision of \r\naccessors in a store. Consider this snippet of code:\r\n```ruby\r\nclass RequestOff < ApplicationRecord\r\n  store :from, accessors: [:date, :period], coder: JSON\r\n  store :to, accessors: [:date, :period], coder: JSON\r\nend\r\n```\r\nThe accessors above will not work because there are two accessors with the same name. To solve the \r\nproblems I either have to change the keys in the store or write my own accessors. The new prefix option\r\nwill fix the problem above by adding a unique prefix to the accessor without changing the underlying key.\r\nExample:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass RequestOff < ApplicationRecord\r\n  store :from, accessors: [:date, :period], coder: JSON, prefix: true\r\n  store :to, accessors: [:date, :period], coder: JSON, prefix: :to\r\nend\r\n\r\nro = RequestOff.new\r\nro.from_date = \"2018-11-1\"\r\n```\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32306, "updated_at": "2018-03-22 04:30:18", "user": 17341000, "closed_at": "None", "id": 306742149, "title": "Add custom prefix to ActiveRecord::Store accessors", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32306", "created_at": "2018-03-20 06:20:52", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/374812004", "text": "Fixed", "created_at": "2018-03-21 01:35:21", "user": 17341000, "id": 374812004}], "assignees": [], "state": "open", "is-pull-request": true}

Currently this is determined by checking if the foreign key name is `fk_rails_` followed by a 10-character hash.\r\n\r\n## Problem\r\n\r\nAt [Cookpad](https://github.com/cookpad), we use [Departure](https://github.com/departurerb/departure) (Percona's pt-online-schema-change runner for ActiveRecord migrations) to run migrations.\r\nOften, `pt-osc` will make a copy of a table in order to run a long migration without blocking it. In this copy process, foreign keys are copied too, but [their name is prefixed with an underscore to prevent name collision](https://www.percona.com/doc/percona-toolkit/LATEST/pt-online-schema-change.html#cmdoption-pt-online-schema-change-alter-foreign-keys-method).\r\n\r\nIn the process described above, we often end up with a development database that contains foreign keys which name starts with `_fk_rails_`.\r\nThat name does not match the ignore pattern, so next time Rails dumps the database schema (eg. when running `rake db:migrate`), our `db/schema.rb` file ends up containing those unwanted foreign key names.\r\nThis also produces an unwanted git diff that we'd prefer not to commit.\r\n\r\n## Suggested solution\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I'd like to suggest a way to expose the foreign key name ignore pattern to the Rails configuration, so that individual projects can decide on a different pattern of foreign keys that will not get their names dumped in `schema.rb`.\r\n\r\nI have confirmed locally that with the following configuration in my Rails application, `_fk_rails_*` foreign key names are not dumped to `schema.rb` anymore:\r\n\r\n```rb\r\nconfig.active_record.fk_ignore_pattern = /^_*#{ActiveRecord::ForeignKeys::PREFIX}_[0-9a-f]{10}$/\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Remaining work\r\n\r\n- [x] Testing\r\n- [x] Documentation\r\n\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32299, "updated_at": "2018-03-22 10:42:48", "user": 816901, "closed_at": "None", "id": 306564386, "title": "Expose foreign key name ignore pattern in configuration", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32299", "created_at": "2018-03-19 17:42:58", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/374302469", "text": "Thanks for the pull request, and welcome!

{"reactions": {}, "text": "### Steps to reproduce\r\nHABTM (has_and_belongs_to_many) associations do not support the dependent option, while other association types do. Of course not all dependent options make sense for HABTM associations, but some of them do. Suppose we have an Author that has and belongs to many Books (an Author can write multiple Books, a Book could be written by multiple Authors), then we might want to show an error when trying to destroy an Author that is still linked to Books. \r\n\r\nSuppose we have the following model:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass Author < ApplicationRecord\r\n  has_and_belongs_to_many :books, dependent: :restrict_with_error, foo: :bar\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nWhen I call destroy on an Author with books, I would expect the destroy to fail and an error message to be set. Or if the dependent option is intentionally unsupported for HABTM association, then I would at least expect an exception when trying to set the option, as is done for unsupported options for other association types.\r\n\r\nFurthermore I would expect an error to be triggered for the unsupported option `foo` either way: `ArgumentError: Unknown key: :foo. Valid keys are: : ...`\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\nThe destroy on the Author with books is not blocked and no error is triggered. Also I don't get an exception setting unsupported options on HABTM associations, while this does happen for other association types.\r\n\r\n### Questions\r\n1. Is the dependent option intentionally unsupported for HABTM associations?\r\n2. If not, what values would we like to support for dependent on HABTM associations and how should they behave?\r\n3. Do we want to trigger an exception when trying to set unsupported options on HABTM associations?\r\n4. Any advice on how to implement this? I did a quick study of the code and see HABTM associations behave kind of differently from other (e.g. has_many) associations. They are not an association in it self, but instead use has_many and belong_to association on a fake JoinModel. I could just write new code in the [HasAndBelongsToMany builder class](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5-2-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/builder/has_and_belongs_to_many.rb) to implement this, but it would be nicer if we could somehow reuse the functionality already in place for [has_many associations](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5-2-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/has_many_association.rb) and the [association builder base class](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/5-2-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/builder/association.rb).\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n**Rails version**: 5.2.0.rc1\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: 2.4.1\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32291, "updated_at": "2018-03-19 16:06:53", "user": 3602336, "closed_at": "None", "id": 306420596, "title": "Dependent option support for has_and_belongs_to_many association", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32291", "created_at": "2018-03-19 11:15:55", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/374216313", "text": "Hi @kreintjes, yes HABTM intentionally doesn't support dependent options because if that's really needed you should probably be using `has_many :through` with a join model as you're probably missing one from your domain model (FYI, HABTM is a custom HMT association). To take your author/book example, the join model you're missing could be a publishing contract. Even if there's no specific model it's likely that you want to add additional attributes to the join which again you need to use a HMT association for.\r\n\r\nYou're right that we should be raising an exception with invalid options - the reason it doesn't like other association methods is because the builder doesn't inherit from the base association builder - happy to accept a PR that adds an exception for unsupported options.", "created_at": "2018-03-19 13:45:00", "user": 6321, "id": 374216313}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/374267281", "text": "I have a real world application where we have some HABTM associations where we are currently using a custom before_destroy callback to prevent the destroy if the association is present (i.e. if the thing we want to destroy is used by some other thing).

I know we could if we use a HMT association with a join model, but we (currently) have no other need for the join model except for setting the dependent.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Today there are two common ways for Rails developers to force their\r\napplications to communicate over HTTPS:\r\n\r\n* `config.force_ssl` is a setting in environment configurations that\r\n  enables the `ActionDispatch::SSL` middleware. With this middleware\r\n  enabled, all HTTP communication to your application will be redirected\r\n  to HTTPS. The middleware also takes care of other best practices by\r\n  setting HSTS headers, upgrading all cookies to secure only, etc.\r\n* The `force_ssl` controller method redirects HTTP requests to certain\r\n  controllers to HTTPS.\r\n\r\nAs a consultant, I've seen many applications with misconfigured HTTPS\r\nsetups due to developers adding `force_ssl` to `ApplicationController`\r\nand not enabling `config.force_ssl`. With this configuration, many\r\napplication requests can be served over HTTP such as assets, requests\r\nthat hit mounted engines, etc. In addition, because cookies are not\r\nupgraded to secure only in this configuration and HSTS headers are not\r\nset, it's possible for cookies that are meant to be secure to be sent\r\nover HTTP.\r\n\r\nThe confusion between these two methods of forcing HTTPS is compounded\r\nby the fact that they share an identical name. This makes finding\r\ndocumentation on the \"right\" method confusing.\r\n\r\nHTTPS throughout is quickly becomming table stakes for all web sites.\r\nSites are expected to operate over HTTPS for all communication,\r\nsensitive or otherwise. Let's encourage use of the broader-reaching\r\n`ActionDispatch::SSL` middleware and elminate this source of user\r\nconfusion. If, for some reason, applications need to expose certain\r\nendpoints over HTTP they can do so by properly configuring\r\n`config.ssl_options`.\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32277, "updated_at": "2018-03-19 14:10:15", "user": 152152, "closed_at": "None", "id": 306169018, "title": "Deprecate controller level force_ssl", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32277", "created_at": "2018-03-17 16:18:54", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/373932448", "text": "r? @sgrif\n\n(@rails-bot has picked a reviewer for you, use r? to override)", "created_at": "2018-03-17 16:18:56", "user": 7468109, "id": 373932448}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/374171376", "text": "@derekprior not 100% convinced of the misconfiguration argument - it's not something I've personally seen in the past few years on a variety of Rails apps and there's been one occurrence on a high-profile website I support where adding `config.force_ssl = true` broke other parts of the site due to the domain wide nature of HSTS headers.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "### Summary\r\nCheck exclude before flagging cookies as secure in ActionDispatch::SSL\r\n\r\nWhen `config.force_ssl = true`, it does three things: \r\n\r\n1. Permanently redirects `http://` requests to `https://`\r\n2. Flags cookies as secure and tells the browser to not send cookies along with `http://` requests \r\n3. Tells the browser to remember the site as TLS-only and automatically redirect non-TLS requests\r\n\r\nWe would typically want all three of these defaults when we enable `config.force_ssl = true`. However, that might not be the case when we want to exclude a request from redirection to an `https://` enabled host.\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfig.force_ssl = true\r\nconfig.ssl_options = {\r\n  redirect: {\r\n    host: ENV[\"APP_HOST\"], \r\n    exclude: -> request { \r\n      request.domain == \"herokuapp.com\" \r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI ran into this issue when trying to migrate Review Apps from Heroku's Public Space to Private Space, where all of Heroku's Review Apps have a default domain `http://<my-pr-app>.herokuapp.com`, and the only way to enable `https` on an app in the Private Space is to give it a custom domain and an SSL cert. Since Review Apps are meant to be spun up temporarily, and torn down, I think adding a custom domain and SSL cert to an app that is meant to be destroyed 24 hours later is a hassle. Heroku recommends in their documentation to exclude redirection to an `https://` enabled site for their default domain `herokuapp.com` in order to access an app without a custom domain in the Private Space.\r\n\r\nWith this setup, I want all requests that don't match the domain `herokuapp.com` to be redirected to an `https://` enabled host, and for all requests that match my example to be excluded from redirection (i.e. `http://<my-pr-app.herokuapp.com`).The problem is, even though I am excluding `herokuapp.com` from redirection, I never get a session cookie because that is automatically set to secure. This means I can never verify the CSRF/authenticity token on any forms I submit. The error I receive when making any `POST`, `PUT`, or `PATCH` request is a status `422 unprocessable entity` and `ActionController::InvalidAuthenticityToken`.\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32262, "updated_at": "2018-03-15 22:00:45", "user": 19142117, "closed_at": "2018-03-15 21:29:22", "id": 305703474, "title": "Check exclude before flagging cookies as secure in ActionDispatch::SSL", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32262", "created_at": "2018-03-15 20:13:57", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/373508160", "text": "Thanks for the pull request, and welcome!

{"reactions": {}, "text": "There's an open issue in the Dalli repository that has emerged with the release of 2.7.7, but looks like it might be a Rails issue.

Access a page\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\nThe page should render\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nAn error is raised - ActionView::Template::Error (nil can't be coerced into Integer)\r\n\r\nThis underlying exception is originally raised in the generate_sid method - https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/b37356ee881c0de4266165dacb8af4efaebaf4ec/lib/rack/session/abstract/id.rb#L254 - in Rack.  The '@sidbits' variable is nil, which causes the error in question.\r\n\r\nThe '@sidbits' variable is nil because of the inclusion of the ActionDispatch::Session::Compatibility module into MemCacheStore.  It's very unclear what this module is supposed to do, and doubly unclear why it's clearing out the '@sidbits' variable.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone on the Rails team have any insight on the above?

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Hi folks,\r\n\r\nThis looks like a small bug in PostgreSQL connection adapter.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "I think I may have spotted a potential race condition in ActiveStorage with how it identifies and analyzes blobs. I noticed in our application that some blobs will be identified and some will be analysed, but not both. This is curious because a bug was fixed in #31138 which meant that the `AnalyzeJob` should merge it's metadata onto the existing metadata - so blobs should end up being identified and analyzed.\r\n\r\nIn our application our queue is quite short, so I suspected that the `AnalyzeJob` was picking up blobs before they had even been identified. Looking at the attachment code it seemed that the blob was identified inline *before* it was queued to be analzyed. It seemed to be as though it was being queued first - and my queue picked the record up before the identification was complete.\r\n\r\n```\r\nclass ActiveStorage::Attachment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  after_create_commit :identify_blob, :analyze_blob_later\r\n\r\n  private\r\n    def identify_blob\r\n      blob.identify\r\n    end\r\n\r\n    def analyze_blob_later\r\n      blob.analyze_later unless blob.analyzed?\r\n    end\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon diving further I came across this line in the documentation: [`In case there are multiple transactional callbacks as seen below, the order is reversed`](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Callbacks.html). If I'm understanding this correctly, it sounds to me like the `analyze_blob_later` method is being called first. There is another issue #20911 which discusses the inconsistent ordering of callbacks.\r\n\r\nI think that the order of the after create callbacks need to be flipped around so that the `AnalyzeJob` will be able to get a blob after it has been identified and so there is no potential for the identification and analyzing to overwrite each other in a race condition. It would mean each record will be updated correctly with their identification and analyzing result rather than one or the other.", "labels": ["activestorage"], "number": 32247, "updated_at": "2018-03-17 23:15:04", "user": 1100408, "closed_at": "None", "id": 305030564, "title": "Potential race condition for ActiveStorage identification and analyzation", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32247", "created_at": "2018-03-14 05:45:04", "comments": [{"reactions": {"+1": [12427222]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/373959917", "text": "I'm seeing the same behavior with a custom analyzer. \r\n\r\nThe `analyze_blob_later` callback correctly merges the custom metadata and updates the record, but then the `identify_blob` callback executes and overwrites the metadata with `identified: true`\r\n\r\nAlso, it seems the task of identification is performed twice, once by the client side where the `content_type` is determined, and again by the `identify_blob` callback.

Called after frameworks initialize.\r\n\r\nIMHO if it is called **after** something - then it should not be considered a part of that something. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure which example is good enough, let's consider this: _After breakfast I take a shower_ - is _taking a shower_ a part of _breakfast_ ? Obviously it is not. I believe the same logic should be applied to rails initialization process and `after_initialize` callback.\r\n\r\n> The after_initialize is called at the end of the whole initialize process\r\n\r\nNeither of the docs says that the callback is run **at the end**, instead all of them say that it is run **after** - there is a significant difference. I would say that the docs are misguiding, but it's not only about that - the callback's name is also confusing in this case. It's all about the word **after** which assumes something to be finished by the moment. And if `Rails.application.initialized?` returns `false` then it literally means that initialization is not finished yet. So on one hand the initialization is finished, and on the other it is not finished - pretty inconsistent.\r\n \r\nI think that despite the behavior of `Rails.application.initialized?` in `config.after_initialize` callback is intentional, the intention itself is not correct.\r\n\r\nupdate.\r\n\r\nOk, I found at https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/9cfeefb637b603ce41d3019c8baa95ea984620d7 the following:\r\n\r\n> * after_initialize: This is run after all of the initializers have run. It is an\r\n>   appropriate place for forking in a preforking setup\r\n\r\nIt explains a bit better the intention of this callback - it is run _after initializers_ - but not _after frameworks initialize_. This should have been placed into the docs. The guides' description of this callback is especially misguiding. Also it means that we in fact do not have a callback to be run after the application completely initializes for real (surely it can be workarounded).", "created_at": "2018-03-14 02:02:03", "user": 1610941, "id": 372879666}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

{"reactions": {"+1": [5300654]}, "text": "See related: #30267\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nSee gist here: https://gist.github.com/project-eutopia/16ec1e121f8e676a989b68c006521cc6\r\n\r\nThe basic problem is that `unscoped` with a block does not seem to be removing `default_scope` when using joins.  The above gist has two models defined:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  has_many :comments\r\n  default_scope { where(active: true) }\r\nend\r\n\r\nclass Comment < ActiveRecord::Base\r\n  belongs_to :post\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen runing a command like `Post.unscoped { Comment.joins(:post) }` it excludes comments which have an inactive post in spite of the `unscoped` on `Post`.\r\n\r\nWhen looking at this problem deeper, the result of `Post.unscoped { Comment.joins(:post).count }` and `Post.unscoped { Comment.joins(:post) }.count` I found to be different:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[2] pry(#<BugTest>)> Post.unscoped { Comment.joins(:post) }.count\r\nD, [2018-03-12T23:23:51.558830 #21161] DEBUG -- :    (0.2ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"comments\" INNER JOIN \"posts\" ON \"posts\".\"id\" = \"comments\".\"post_id\" AND \"posts\".\"active\" = ?  [[\"active\", \"t\"]]\r\n=> 1\r\n[3] pry(#<BugTest>)> Post.unscoped { Comment.joins(:post).count }\r\nD, [2018-03-12T23:23:58.246219 #21161] DEBUG -- :    (0.3ms)  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM \"comments\" INNER JOIN \"posts\" ON \"posts\".\"id\" = \"comments\".\"post_id\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis leads me to believe that the problem might be due to lazy loading.  For instance, running `Post.unscoped { Comment(:post).to_a }` returns an array of the comments I expect, because I have forced it to do the evaluation inside the block.  This problem arises when trying to do something like the following:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ncomments = Post.unscoped { Comment.joins(:post) }\r\ncomments.each do |comment|\r\n  # No comments with inactive posts seem to be present here\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\n\r\n`Post.unscoped` should return an association that remembers that `Post` is unscoped for the queries inside of the block.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\nThe `default_scope` seems to remain when using the association returned by `unscoped`.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: 5.1.4, 5.2.0.rc1, and 6.0.0.alpha\r\n**Ruby version**: 2.5.0\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32235, "updated_at": "2018-03-15 07:27:05", "user": 5336619, "closed_at": "2018-03-13 10:27:50", "id": 304643987, "title": "`unscoped` not remembering `default_scope` for associations", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32235", "created_at": "2018-03-13 06:36:05", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/372618241", "text": "@project-eutopia as you've rightly surmised, the point at which you evaluate the scope is important - `unscoped` with a block will only unstop the model for the duration of that block and this is a common  pattern within Rails (e.g. Time.use_zone changes the timezone for the block) and is not a bug.\r\n\r\nA better way of achieving what you want is to add another association, e.g:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nclass Comment < ApplicationRecord\r\n   belongs_to :unscoped_post, -> { unscoped }, class_name: \"Post\"\r\nend\r\n\r\ncomments = Comment.joins(:unscoped_post)\r\ncomments.each do |comment|\r\n  # Comments with inactive posts here\r\nend\r\n```\r\n\r\nGenerally I find it's best to use default_scope sparingly - it's easy to add conditions but much harder to remove them.", "created_at": "2018-03-13 10:27:50", "user": 6321, "id": 372618241}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/373265925", "text": "@pixeltrix Thank you for your review and clear explanation of the situation.

Sometimes though, when requests are happening to the application while starting it up (in production mode), the serializer seems to be loaded and applied twice. From then on, the application is in this \"damaged\" state and the serializer does not work anymore.\r\n\r\nBy *applied twice* I mean that it is called a first time, and then this result is supplied to the serializer a second time. So with a value of `a,b,c,d`, we're getting `[['a', 'b', 'c']]` instead of `['a', 'b', 'c']` (note that it is wrapped in another array). Of course this is specific to our serializer and may lead to different problems with other ones.\r\n\r\n### System configuration\r\n\r\n**Rails version**: `5.1.4`\r\n\r\n**Ruby version**: `jruby 9.1.14.0 (2.3.3)`, `java 8`\r\n\r\n**Container**: Apache tomcat\r\n\r\n### Conclusion\r\n\r\nWe think this a race-condition or code loading issue in Rails and possibly related to #28589 and / or #27418.

Use Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options#add_extension instead.`\r\n\r\n### Analysis\r\n\r\nIn https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/29b5be0a72331df9ab99e36b05b4c29cf7046f30/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/chrome/driver.rb#L67 it is expected that the driver is getting an `options` key with a proper `Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options` object.

Merge will be difficult as `Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options` does not have a `merge` method. `profile` is not merged so my above workaround works.\r\n\r\nTo solve this, I thought about:\r\n- Changing the `driven_by`'s `options` parameter to accept a WebDriver options object (like  `Selenium::WebDriver::Chrome::Options` here), and use this options object when adding default driver options\r\n- or allowing `driven_by` to take a block parameter, with the options object as argument. This would allow something like:\r\n    ```ruby\r\n    driven_by :selenium, using: :headless_chrome, screen_size: [1600, 1200] do |options|\r\n      options.add_preference(:download, default_directory: DL_PATH)\r\n    end\r\n    ```\r\n\r\ncc @eileencodes ", "labels": ["actionpack"], "number": 32197, "updated_at": "2018-03-11 12:37:44", "user": 42070, "closed_at": "None", "id": 303509139, "title": "[ActionDispatch] SystemTesting: custom options are ignored", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32197", "created_at": "2018-03-08 14:57:29", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/371871908", "text": "@renchap do you want to work on a PR?

The logic is not straightforward and a lot of things are called `options` and `opts`, which does not make it easier :)\r\n\r\nEach Capybara drivers expects an `options` argument as a `Hash`. This is the `driven_by`'s `options` arg.\r\n\r\nThis `options` arg is then passed to the Selenium Webdriver `initialize` call.\r\nFor Chrome (the other drivers may be different), see here: https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/blob/master/rb/lib/selenium/webdriver/chrome/driver.rb\r\n\r\nSome keys of the `options` arg are used to set specific settings (`:driver_path`, `:url`, …).\r\nOther keys have specific behaviour, like `:args` or `:prefs` (correctly setting it but displaying a deprecation notice).\r\nFor `:profile`, depending on the sub-key, it sets something (`:directory`), or sets something but with a deprecation notice (`:extensions`), or  it is ignored.\r\n\r\nAll of this currently works fine.\r\n\r\nThe problem I encountered is when you want to pass a an `:options` key (so `options[:options]`).

Nothing has changed except it and code style since March 8.\r\n\r\nP.S.(on March 15)\r\nChanged option name again to `year_format`. \r\n\r\n### Other Information\r\n\r\nIn Japan, Wareki, the Japanese calender, is used as often as Western Calender. For example, 2000 A.D. is Heisei 12 in Wareki. It is even used in official documents. Therefore, there is a need for date select box with Wareki years. Some other countries like Israel and Thailand also have their own calenders, so I think the number of people who need this `use_year_names` option is not small.\r\n\r\n", "labels": [], "number": 32190, "updated_at": "2018-03-19 03:23:47", "user": 26531068, "closed_at": "None", "id": 303142622, "title": "Add `use_year_names` option to date_select tag", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32190", "created_at": "2018-03-07 15:27:33", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/371174945", "text": "Thanks for the pull request, and welcome!

I have a feeling that there must be a market in need of, say, `wareki-rails` gem that would aid the date/time conversion. I also think that it's more appropriate to be in a separate gem as it's very Japan-specific feature (otherwise I'd already submit patch for Buddhist year for Thailand 😄)", "created_at": "2018-03-08 01:20:56", "user": 4912, "id": 371344535}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/371406527", "text": "@yskkin @rafaelfranca @sikachu \r\nThanks for your reviews!\r\nWell, I understand what you say. I don't think that this `use_year_names` option is the best way to achieve this goal, either. So at first I thought about implementing this option using `%d` as  @yskkin says, but I couldn't find a simple way to pass different number in `%d` and value of option tag, so I used array. It's the same way as `use_month_names` option, which already exists.\r\nAnd as @sikachu says, it is true that Wareki is unique problem in Japan. However, I still think that rails needs an option like I proposed (though I don't stick to the format in this PR). In the case of Thai Buddhist calender, to store data properly, the HTML options should be like:\r\n\r\n```HTML\r\n<option value=\"2008\">2551</option>\r\n<option value=\"2009\">2552</option>\r\n<option value=\"2010\">2553</option>\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut now `year` field in date_select doesn't have a way to use different number in option value and what is displayed. Since Western Calender is not the only format of year, I think rails at least needs a way to put different value in these two as in `month` field.\r\n", "created_at": "2018-03-08 07:44:03", "user": 26531068, "id": 371406527}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/371411418", "text": "Actually, one good way that we can achieve this is maybe letting user pass in a proc?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\ndate_select('user_birthday', '', start_year: 1998, end_year: 2000, labels_for_year_options: ->{ |year| convert_year_to_wareki(year) })\r\n```", "created_at": "2018-03-08 08:08:25", "user": 4912, "id": 371411418}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/371412939", "text": "It seems much better for me.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "### Summary\r\n\r\nThis is a fix for a bug @tenderlove and I have been stepping through together.\r\n\r\n`URI.unescape` in Rails 4.2 throws an `Encoding::CompatibilityError` if the (UTF-8 tagged) argument contains actual Unicode characters. ~This doesn't happen on 3.x; compare the monkey-patches:~ Turns out this was a patch made in our own application.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Recently @eileencodes made me aware of this PullRequest https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/32136 and plans to possibly make `Preloader` a Public API.\r\n\r\nWe've been using `Associations:Preloader` at GitHub as part of our https://github.com/Shopify/graphql-batch setup to preload associations during GraphQL queries. Over the past month we've hit some pretty nasty issues with it. I believe these may have to be fixed before making the Preloader a public concern.\r\n\r\n### Loading already loaded records\r\n\r\nThe main issue is this line: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/preloader.rb#L180\r\n\r\nWhen preloading an association on a list of records, if this association is already loaded on the first record of the list, it is assumed that the whole list is loaded. In these cases, a `AlreadyLoaded` preloader is returned, and uses `association(name).target` to read the preloaded records.\r\n\r\nIn a public setting, I don't think we can make this assumption, in fact, using `preload` with a list of records might result in this scenario:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\na = Record.create!\r\nb = Record.create!\r\nc = Record.create!\r\n\r\na.some_association.create!\r\n\r\npreloaders = ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader.new.preload([a,b,c], [:some_association])\r\n\r\npreloaders.first.preloaded_records\r\n=> [Only the association for a is preloaded]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt GitHub we worked around this problem by always checking if the association was already loaded, before passing a record to `Preloader`, filtering them out if needed. That solved most issues until we hit issues that were out of our control.\r\n\r\nTake through associations for example:\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/preloader/through_association.rb#L8-L14\r\n\r\nIf we take\r\n\r\n```\r\nhas_many :patients, through: :appointments , source: :client\r\n```\r\n\r\nFirst, appointments are preloaded on patients. Then, `client` is preloaded on all patients. If the first appointment's client was already loaded, we'll get back only the client.\r\n\r\nWhen returning the preloaded records, we'll try to get the target association on all records, but the whole tail of the list of records will be `nil` because they weren't actually loaded.\r\n\r\nIn certain versions of Rails, `association.reader` is used instead of `target` if the association is not loaded. This is almost worst because it will silently generate N+1's.\r\n\r\nAnother gotcha this behaviour introduces is that you cannot use `Preloader` with different types of records / associations.\r\n\r\nFor example, one issue we hit was that we were preloading an association on two different types of records at the same time:\r\n\r\n```\r\nPreloader.new.preload([doctor, patient, patient_b], [:appointment])\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn our case, `appoitments` on one of the records was a `has_one through:`, and the other one was a `belongs to`. During the `has_one through` preloading logic, an association was loaded on the other kind of record. When it was time to load the second kind of record, since the association was already loaded for the first record, Preloader was skipping the whole list again.\r\n\r\nIf needed, I can provide failing tests for some of these tricky scenarios.\r\n\r\n### Preloading different object_ids\r\n\r\nAnother smaller issue is that the preloader currently `uniq!` the records before preloading them. This means that passing multiple objects for the same record will result in only the first record being preloaded.\r\n\r\nWe work around that by deduping the records before passing them to Preloader, and we copy over the associations after.\r\n\r\n### Takeaways\r\n\r\nCurrently, Rails assumes the preloader is ran in a certain context (its a private API right now after all). It breaks quickly when its used in other ways. It would be really awesome for us to make it a Public API, and it would be great to find a way around these gotchas!\r\n\r\ncc @eileencodes @tenderlove", "labels": [], "number": 32140, "updated_at": "2018-03-08 02:14:25", "user": 1919498, "closed_at": "None", "id": 301142583, "title": "Issues with Associations::Preloader used as a Public API", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32140", "created_at": "2018-02-28 18:59:33", "comments": [{"reactions": {"+1": [1919498, 122436]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/369351057", "text": "> When preloading an association on a list of records, if this association is already loaded on the first record of the list, it is assumed that the whole list is loaded.\r\n\r\nWe need to fix this case.\r\n\r\n> preloading an association on two different types of records at the same time:\r\n\r\nThis is not going to be allowed by the public API, it will raise in case you pass incompatible objects.\r\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/pull/32136/files#diff-bf6dd6226db3aab589916f09236881c7R1198\r\n\r\n> Preloading different object_ids\r\n\r\nAlso should be fixed.", "created_at": "2018-02-28 19:17:27", "user": 47848, "id": 369351057}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/369437681", "text": "> it will raise in case you pass incompatible objects\r\n\r\nDepends where you call it; it'd be possible to have two members of an inheritance hierarchy with different definitions of an association.

I actually like the idea of homogeneity because a call to `#preload` implies one query for one listed association. The cognitive load of mixing different types of records that happen to have common associations (or common associations names) is pretty high for me as I'm reading code but maybe that's just because I'm not used to it. That's another one of the reasons I like exposing Preloader via Relation rather than viewing it as a separate service.~~ Discovered that Preloader already groups records by association class to handle non-homogeneous collections! https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations/preloader.rb#L139 I think it makes sense to expose this to public API; I will remove the incompatible object check.

For example, a native iOS/Android client.\r\n\r\nWe have a Rails UI which uses the built in direct upload stuff. But we also have an iOS client that needs to upload files. Our iOS client first creates a `Blob` via `POST /api/uploads` (which is a controller that inherits from `ActiveStorage::DirectUploadsController`). As of Rails 5.2.0.rc1 the response looked like this:\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"id\": 1,\r\n  \"key\": \"AHPU4cV8yHWYzoGfaaRuTQzg\",\r\n  \"filename\": \"some-file.png\",\r\n  \"content_type\": \"image/png\",\r\n  \"metadata\": {},\r\n  \"byte_size\": 15844,\r\n  \"checksum\": \"dHJ4QIEDJy7mxfm0IE09xw==\",\r\n  \"created_at\": \"2018-03-07T20:17:36.756Z\",\r\n  \"signed_id\": \"eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaHBCZz09IiwiZXhwIjpudWxsLCJwdXIiOiJibG9iX2lkIn19--5e5775d4c690a6a4171abb69e25e50e91f8a61cd\",\r\n  \"direct_upload\": {\r\n    \"url\": \"http://localhost:5000/rails/active_storage/disk/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsibWVzc2FnZSI6IkJBaDdDVG9JYTJWNVNTSWRRVWhRVlRSalZqaDVTRmRaZW05SFptRmhVblZVVVhwbkJqb0dSVlE2RVdOdmJuUmxiblJmZEhsd1pVa2lEbWx0WVdkbEwzQnVad1k3QmxRNkUyTnZiblJsYm5SZmJHVnVaM1JvYVFMa1BUb05ZMmhsWTJ0emRXMUpJaDFrU0VvMFVVbEZSRXA1TjIxNFptMHdTVVV3T1hoM1BUMEdPd1pVIiwiZXhwIjoiMjAxOC0wMy0wN1QyMDoyMjozNi43ODBaIiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl90b2tlbiJ9fQ==--c639a4499a4159ae7c6d3abcf4ce8a89b23ba964\",\r\n    \"headers\": {\r\n      \"Content-Type\": \"image/png\"\r\n    }\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe client then pulls out the `direct_upload.url` to know where to PUT the file. Will that URL be changing to root-relative with this PR? If so, that's quite a change for clients.

I think we need to fix that part first before exposing the power of Preloader to the audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Offtopic\r\n\r\nYou may see the implementation that is efficient for us:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\n  def preload_into_association(host_association, *preload_associations)\r\n    # Preloading records in such a weird way\r\n    # Because we want to cache them inside an association\r\n    # but not have a separated scope as a result of #preload call\r\n    preload_associations.each do |preload_association|\r\n      collection = send(host_association)\r\n      unpreloaded = collection.reject {|l| l.association(preload_association).loaded?}\r\n      ActiveRecord::Associations::Preloader.new.preload(unpreloaded, preload_association)\r\n    end\r\n  end\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is how it is used:\r\n\r\n``` ruby\r\nSite.has_many :campaigns\r\nCampaign.has_many :assets\r\n\r\nsite.preload_into_association(:campaigns, :assets)\r\n# which is better than\r\nsite.campaigns.preload(:assets) \r\n# because it generates new relation and site.campaigns.map(&:assets) is not cached...EVER...  \r\n```\r\n\r\nYou may see that we filter out loaded records with loaded association from collection which resolves the original problem I described.

If you don't want to have association presence validated, use optional: true.\r\n\r\nThat means that removing the validation should suffice, since it is required by default.

My guess for what it means is that the new app generator will put it in your initializers or some config file. Which does not make it `true` by default as mentioned in the docs.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "### Summary\r\n\r\nFrom project to project written with Rails I spectate the similar snag, when **column definition rows in the schema are shuffled** from time to time (only for `schema.rb` in `:ruby` mode). It's annoying to see the changes in the git index, despite I haven't touched any of them. It's really hard for me to define the steps to reproduce for this bug, but let me put here my thoughts and proposed changes. First consider the next example for better clarity:\r\n```\r\n     t.string \"county\"\r\n-    t.string \"country_code\"\r\n     t.datetime \"created_at\", null: false\r\n     t.datetime \"updated_at\", null: false\r\n+    t.string \"country_code\"\r\n     t.string \"urn\"\r\n```\r\nHere \"country_code\" column definition changed position even though there was no any related migration code.\r\n\r\nFirst of all I thought this behaviour is connected somehow with database engine version or operating system version divergence between developers in our team. So we setup the same version of Rails 4.2 (later checked on 5.2) and MySQL 5.7.20 on macOS Sierra 10.12.6 at MacBook Pro. But there was no luck – I still spectate schema shuffling.\r\n\r\nThen I decided to dig into the schema dumper code to understand how ActiveRecord retrieves columns information and dumps it to the `schema.rb` file. Inside I noticed expected [alphabetical table names sorting](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/schema_dumper.rb#L90):\r\n```\r\ndef tables(stream)\r\n  sorted_tables = @connection.tables.sort\r\n\r\n   sorted_tables.each do |table_name|\r\n    table(table_name, stream) unless ignored?(table_name)\r\n  end\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\nThen I found [table columns info retrievement](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/schema_dumper.rb#L105):\r\n```\r\ndef table(table, stream)\r\n  columns = @connection.columns(table)\r\n...\r\n```\r\nSo there is no specific ordering. \"Hmmn\" 🤔 , – was sparkled in my – \"Maybe it's desirable to show columns definition in the same manera as database holds them and don't sort in alphabetical order. But how different databases return schema info and do they comply the result order?\". I moved to connection adapters:\r\n• **MySQL** ([`ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::AbstractMysqlAdapter`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract_mysql_adapter.rb#L801))\r\n```\r\ndef column_definitions(table_name) # :nodoc:\r\n  execute_and_free(\"SHOW FULL FIELDS FROM #{quote_table_name(table_name)}\", \"SCHEMA\") do |result|\r\n    each_hash(result)\r\n  end\r\nend\r\n```\r\nI haven't found any proof in the [`SHOW COLUMNS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/show-columns.html) (synonym to `SHOW FIELDS`) MySQL official documentation that ordering is present. But I found the next interesting discussions – [\"SHOW DATABASES does not order infomation_schema correct\"](https://bugs.mysql.com/bug.php?id=14473) and [\"Return order of MySQL SHOW COLUMNS\r\n\"](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2544751/return-order-of-mysql-show-columns) – where people argue how MySQL handles position of columns info. Unfortunately, I'm not able to trace MySQL server source code to find the pure evidence. Let's assume **all this means `column_definitions`doesn't gauranty the order.** Do we have alternatives? Yes!\r\n- [`DESCRIBE`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/describe.html) (the clone of `SHOW COLUMNS`, that leads me to the idea MySQL follows the same \"There is more than one way to do it\" principle as Ruby/Perl 😄  ) \r\n- [`INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/columns-table.html)\r\n\r\nMySQL has **ORDINAL POSITION** of the columns and provides it in `INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS`. But there is one note, that makes me confused:\r\n> `ORDINAL_POSITION` is necessary because you might want to say `ORDER BY ORDINAL_POSITION`. Unlike `SHOW`, `SELECT` does not have automatic ordering.\r\n\r\nSeems like thoeretically `SHOW` should keep the order according to what I see in the note, but practically I see the opposite. Unlike Postgres, [MySQL allows to insert column before or after specific one](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/alter-table.html#alter-table-add-drop-column).\r\n I'd be very pleasant to hear any thoughts and get any references regarding  the columns positioning (logical, physical, virtual, etc.) here.\r\n\r\n• **Postgres** ([`ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::PostgreSQLAdapter`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/postgresql_adapter.rb#L748))\r\n```\r\ndef column_definitions(table_name)\r\n  query(<<-end_sql, \"SCHEMA\")\r\n              SELECT a.attname, format_type(a.atttypid, a.atttypmod),\r\n                     pg_get_expr(d.adbin, d.adrelid), a.attnotnull, a.atttypid, a.atttypmod,\r\n                     c.collname, col_description(a.attrelid, a.attnum) AS comment\r\n                FROM pg_attribute a\r\n                LEFT JOIN pg_attrdef d ON a.attrelid = d.adrelid AND a.attnum = d.adnum\r\n                LEFT JOIN pg_type t ON a.atttypid = t.oid\r\n                LEFT JOIN pg_collation c ON a.attcollation = c.oid AND a.attcollation <> t.typcollation\r\n               WHERE a.attrelid = #{quote(quote_table_name(table_name))}::regclass\r\n                 AND a.attnum > 0 AND NOT a.attisdropped\r\n               ORDER BY a.attnum\r\n  end_sql\r\nend\r\n```\r\nSchema info retrievement is pretty straightforward from `pg_attribute` system table. We have explicit `ORDER BY a.attnum` ([a.attnum](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/catalog-pg-attribute.html) – the number of the column), which should guarantee the order of attributes I guess. Unlike MySQL, Postgres doesn't allow to insert column before or after specific one.\r\n\r\n• **SQlite3** ([`ActiveRecord::ConnectionAdapters::SQLite3Adapter`](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite3_adapter.rb#L395))\r\n```\r\ndef table_structure(table_name)\r\n  structure = exec_query(\"PRAGMA table_info(#{quote_table_name(table_name)})\", \"SCHEMA\")\r\n  ...\r\n```\r\n[`PRAGMA table_info`](https://www.sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_table_info) lacks the required knowledge, that's why [ActiveRecord uses](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/sqlite3_adapter.rb#L516) [`sqlite_master`](http://www.sqlite.org/faq.html#q7) readonly table to get and parse initial table creation SQL. As far as we parse the SQL statements all the time, it could be considered as columns order guarantee. Here is an excerpt from the [`ALTER TABLE`](http://sqlite.org/lang_altertable.html) official documentation regarding column position specification:\r\n> The ADD COLUMN syntax is used to add a new column to an existing table. The new column is always appended to the end of the list of existing columns.\r\n\r\n### Alternatives\r\n\r\nAny sorting, especially if it's not supported in the database, could be performed at schema dumper level. For example, dumper sorts table names in the alphabetical order right now. The same approach could be applied to the columns. Moreover we may enforce ordering at both levels – **database query** and **schema dumper table info processing**.\r\n\r\n### Considertations\r\n\r\nHow do different databases consider the columns order? AFAIK, there are 2 points:\r\n- Columns order from fixed length to variable length provides performance boost, because it's easier to find the offset of the fixed field. That's why primary key is better to place in the beginning of the table. \r\n- Columns order doesn't much matter from user point of view, because columns order at the logical level could be different from how database spread columns at the physical level. That means you don't have to be bothered with column position tuning, database engine better knows how to store the data.\r\n\r\n### Proposed changes\r\n\r\n- Force MySQL adapter to retrieve columns definition in the same order.\r\n\r\nDoes all this make sense? Please shout out if I have to cover provided changes with specs somewhere else.

The field is required and should contain a placeholder. As we all know we can achieve this by using `select` and `:prompt` option. \r\n\r\nExample from docs: \r\n```ruby\r\nselect(\"post\", \"person_id\", Person.all.collect {|p| [ p.name, p.id ] }, {prompt: 'Select Person'})\r\n```\r\noutputs \r\n```html\r\n<select name=\"post[person_id]\" id=\"post_person_id\">\r\n  <option value=\"\">Select Person</option>\r\n  <option value=\"1\">David</option>\r\n  <option value=\"2\">Eileen</option>\r\n  <option value=\"3\">Rafael</option>\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\nAn important detail is that placeholder MUST be disabled. This is logically correct. If you have a required field you do not want anyone to submit a placeholder and displaying error messages is also not that fancy.\r\n\r\nGoing forward one can assume that if we have an option tag with a value equals to an empty string, that means you can employ `:selected` and `:disabled` options to gain precise control over it. It works on any option provided by the client but not on the default one.\r\n\r\n### Actual behavior\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nselect(\"post\", \"person_id\", Person.all.collect {|p| [ p.name, p.id ] }, {prompt: 'Select Person', selected: '', disabled: ''})\r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<select name=\"post[person_id]\" id=\"post_person_id\">\r\n  <option value=\"\">Select Person</option>\r\n  <option value=\"1\">David</option>\r\n  <option value=\"2\">Eileen</option>\r\n  <option value=\"3\">Rafael</option>\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected behavior\r\nThe usage of generic helper methods should be transparent. I expect provided options not to be silently ignored but to be placed as attributes on a placeholder option.\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<select name=\"post[person_id]\" id=\"post_person_id\">\r\n  <option value=\"\" disabled=\"disabled\" selected=\"selected\">Select Person</option>\r\n  <option value=\"1\">David</option>\r\n  <option value=\"2\">Eileen</option>\r\n  <option value=\"3\">Rafael</option>\r\n</select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nOne may notice that it is possible to pass empty option manually:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhelper.select(\"post\", \"person_id\", [['Select name', ''], [\"Peter\", 1], [\"Maria\", 2], [\"Justas\", 3]], {required: true, selected: '', disabled: ''})\r\n```\r\n```html\r\n<select name=\"post[person_id]\" id=\"post_person_id\">\r\n<option selected=\"selected\" disabled=\"disabled\" value=\"\">Select name</option>\r\n<option value=\"1\">Peter</option>\r\n<option value=\"2\">Maria</option>\r\n<option value=\"3\">Justas</option></select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nwell it would be sufficient unless `required` option jumps in and produces another empty option:\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nhelper.select(\"post\", \"person_id\", [['Select name', ''], [\"Peter\", 1], [\"Maria\", 2], [\"Justas\", 3]], {required: true, selected: '', disabled: ''}, {required: true}) \r\n```\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<select required=\"required\" name=\"post[person_id]\" id=\"post_person_id\">\r\n<option value=\"\"></option>\r\n<option selected=\"selected\" disabled=\"disabled\" value=\"\">Select name</option>\r\n<option value=\"1\">Peter</option>\r\n<option value=\"2\">Maria</option>\r\n<option value=\"3\">Justas</option></select>\r\n```\r\n\r\nA lot of stuff has been built on top of this implementation([simple_form](https://github.com/plataformatec/simple_form/) is among those, needless to say, that a lot of custom stuff is based on `simple_form` itself. ).

This happens while updating a record's attributes in bulk. A quick survey seemed to show that `assign_attributes` decrements the counter once, and `save!` decrements it a second time in the following code: https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/persistence.rb#L429-L430.\r\n\r\nMay or may not be related to #31491 and #31493.", "labels": [], "number": 32079, "updated_at": "2018-03-01 22:55:47", "user": 14120117, "closed_at": "2018-03-01 22:55:47", "id": 299295685, "title": "Double decrement on counter_cache under specific conditions", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/32079", "created_at": "2018-02-22 10:19:54", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/369759986", "text": "Seems the same issue with #31493.

I call them `--handlers` (or `-x` for short, as `-h` is\r\nalready as the shortcut for `--help`) to avoid the `rails server\r\n--server` tantrum.\r\n\r\nThe new interface of `rails server` is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nUsage:\r\n  rails server [handler] [options]\r\n\r\nOptions:\r\n  -p, [--port=port]                        # Runs Rails on the specified port - defaults to 3000.\r\n  -b, [--binding=IP]                       # Binds Rails to the specified IP - defaults to 'localhost' in development and '0.0.0.0' in other environments'.\r\n  -c, [--config=file]                      # Uses a custom rackup configuration.\r\n                                           # Default: config.ru\r\n  -d, [--daemon], [--no-daemon]            # Runs server as a Daemon.\r\n  -e, [--environment=name]                 # Specifies the environment to run this server under (development/test/production).\r\n  -x, [--handler=name]                     # Specifies the Rack server to run the application (thin/puma/webrick).\r\n  -P, [--pid=PID]                          # Specifies the PID file.\r\n                                           # Default: tmp/pids/server.pid\r\n  -C, [--dev-caching], [--no-dev-caching]  # Specifies whether to perform caching in development.\r\n      [--early-hints], [--no-early-hints]  # Enables HTTP/2 early hints.\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs a bonus, if you mistype the handler, you'll get an auto-correction\r\nmessage:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ rails s tin\r\nCould not find handler 'tin'. Maybe you meant 'thin' or 'cgi'?\r\nRun `rails server --help` for more options.\r\n```", "labels": [], "number": 32058, "updated_at": "2018-03-04 21:33:37", "user": 604618, "closed_at": "2018-03-04
