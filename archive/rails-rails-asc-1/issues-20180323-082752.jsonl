Especially since it works in 3.0 and rails-master. It might be authentication/authorization that doesn't go quite well, because certain signed in users are not allowed to change the site_id. (I'm using devise, cancan and inherited_resources in this controller).\n\nThe other project has been around for a lot longer (was started with rails 3.0.0.beta, if I remember correctly) and has a lot more gem dependencies.\n\nThere were some errors I can understand that come from the identity map. I have these classes:\n\n<pre>\nclass User &lt; ActiveRecord::Base\nend\nmodule Authentication\n  class User &lt; ::User\n  end\nend\n</pre>\n\n\nAnd it sometimes picks the wrong one. This pattern sounded really cool when I first heard about it, but caused me nothing but headaches, but that's besides the point.\n\nI got this one a couple of times:\n\n<pre>\nput :update, :project_id => project.id, :id => comment.id, :comment => { :body => \"\" }, :format => :js\nJSON.parse(response.body).should have_key('errors') # fails\n</pre>\n\n\nAnd some that look like this:\n\n<pre>\nuser = Factory :user\ncomment1 = Factory :comment, :user => user\ncomment2 = Factory :comment, :user => user\nsubject.comments &lt;&lt; comment1 &lt;&lt; comment2\nsubject.save!\nsubject.reload.comments.should == [ comment1, comment2 ]\n</pre>\n\n\nWhere I get just one comment instead of both. But when I removed the call to `reload` it worked again.\nIt works without the reload in 3.0 too, and I'm not entirely sure why I put it there in the first place. I guess putting reload in is one of the first things I try to do when debugging something.\n\nI guess the majority of failing specs fail because they happened to be accidentally passing before. I found a couple instances where I was testing the wrong object. So I think this update will be a huge improvement and help you find bugs faster than before.\n\nEdit: well, that didn't turn out to be very brief at all! :)\n", "created_at": "2010-10-08 23:25:09", "user": 12692, "id": 457416}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/469085", "text": "Hey Iain, you should try it now, in the latests commits i added a middleware to flush identity map on each requests, flush IM on tests and many other things that you can check out in today's commits.\n\nFeel free to add me on IM miloops at gmail in case to discuss any problem you are having.\n", "created_at": "2010-10-14 19:24:37", "user": 3359, "id": 469085}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/469175", "text": "It seems to work fine when running the the server, but I still have some issues running my specs.

However, I am not quite comfortable with this approach. Using .extend in runtime is slow (as it busts Ruby's method cache) and the patch also introduces a new API that is quite similar to AS::Callbacks.\n\nThe best way to solve the first problem is to have a callbacks system in the response, something like response.close_callback { }, and the block would be called once close! is invoked. Then the current AD::Callback middleware would simply do something like:\n\n```\nif response.respond_to?(:close) && response.respond_to?(:close_callback)\n  response.close_callback { _run_after_callbacks }\nelse\n  _run_after_callbacks\nend\n```\n\nBut we would need to break _run_call_callbacks in AD::Callback in two. The only problem with this approach, afaik, is that it is non deterministic when stuff gets unloaded. Maybe we could use a proxy to wrap objects that do not respond to close! and ensure it gets called in all cases.

You are right, if this is only for development, there is no need to worry with performance.\n\nThe second problem was about introducing a new class.

We already have the information if we should run it in each request or not inside the middleware: https://github.com/bigfix/rails/blob/732669640c8ed4c9955bfeb8f58fa87c1631029a/actionpack/lib/action_dispatch/middleware/callbacks.rb#L47\n\nOne last thing is that the \"railties/lib/rails/console/app.rb\" change is wrong. If we had AD::Callbacks and AD::Reloader, both should be called, because stuff like reloading I18n or setting observers occurs in AD::Callbacks and after your change, it won't happen again.

But I definitely agree it has two: execute request callbacks and execute reload-like callbacks. before and after callbacks fits the first description, to_prepare and to_reload the second. So I am ok if we split these in two middlewares, one being AD::Reload, just be careful with:\n\n1) to_prepare is like before() for Reload and to_reload is after(). The difference though, is that to_prepare is executed when the middleware is initialized. This is not necessarily good and we should remove it as the middleware will never be initialized in production once it is part of AD::Reload, so we will need to add an initializer here (https://github.com/bigfix/rails/blob/master/railties/lib/rails/application/finisher.rb#L37). That should work like this:\n\n```\ninitializer :run_prepare_callbacks do\n  ActionDispatch::Reloader.prepare!\nend\n```\n\n2) Backward compatibility. Maybe AD::Callbacks.to_prepare can delegate to AD::Reload.to_prepare. We can worry about adding a deprecation warning later.\n\nThanks for the patience and the feedback.

Let me know if I'm out of line.\n\nThis patch is related to:\n\nhttps://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/5060\n\nI've got a different approach to the problem that seems (to me) to be more semantically \"correct\" and has some performance bennies as well.\n\nI propose changing the semantics to make :limit and :offset happen before count, which makes them consistent with the other ActiveRecord aggregate calculations -- e.g. sum(:limit => foo) operates only on the limited rows.\n\nIf we do that, then there are two performance wins:\n1. If the app developer desires a count of a limited set (e.g. the number of records that will be shown on the next page) of a ginormous table, they won't have to choose between instantiating the records (to use Array#length) and having the database count every row in the table that matches before returning.  With this approach, the database will shortcut its count as soon as it collects offset + limit rows.\n2. If an app ever does a count(:limit => 0) in some corner case, we don't have to hit the database at all.  We can just return zero.\n\nAs well as the fact that then count == length == size, so this issue is resolved.\n\nAttached is a patch that implements what I described.  Note that I also changed the tests for issue 6268, as if this approach is acceptable, those constraints would no longer apply.\n\nOn the \"why'd he do that?\" side of things, since Arel doesn't support subqueries, there's some trickery to make that happen in calculations.build_count_subquery.  I'd really like to be able to do this inside Arel, but it appears that's not possible right now.  Given that relational algebra doesn't define limit and offset, Arel could alternatively change the behavior of its own count operation for future versions in a similar way without opening the floodgates to generic subqueries.\n\nAdmittedly this patch is pretty edgy because of the Arel workaround, so even if you buy the semantic change, I could see wanting to change the behavior at the Arel layer instead.  I just wanted to submit this as a proof of concept (all tests pass on the 4 default DB drivers) and see what people think.  Likewise, there may be legitimate reasons that this approach isn't desirable.  Please let me know what you think and I'll be glad to move the ball forward.\n\nThanks,\n-john\n", "labels": [], "number": 201, "updated_at": "2014-06-15 10:33:11", "user": 40619, "closed_at": "2011-03-30 16:55:46", "id": 645844, "title": "Count behavior", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/201", "created_at": "2011-03-04 05:01:50", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/854966", "text": "+1 for this approach.

Here's a Postgres 8.4.4 query plan for the two forms against a 2 million row table running on my MacBook.  Note that the number of rows operated on in the sequential scan in the subquery form is shortcut after the LIMIT is reached.  Also the runtimes appear to strongly favor the subquery approach.  Obviously each database's query optimizer is different, but this is an operation that at least Postgres can optimize extremely well.  I believe Sqlite3 and MySQL can do the same, but will do more research.\n\nI definitely don't disagree that the count of the next page's records is easy to arrive at once you've either done a count of the unlimited query (which, as the example below shows can be quite expensive in and of itself), and min'd that against your page size.  Alternatively you can avoid hitting all the matching rows in the table if you use to_a and instantiate the whole next pageful of records (which could be moderately expensive if there are a number of branchy includes), but otherwise the present state of ActiveRecord doesn't allow you to get at what I see to be a very useful optimization provided by the database, while also not being semantically in line with the rest of ActiveRecord's aggregate calculations.\n\nCheers,\n-john\n\n```\ncount_test=# select count(*) from stuff;\n  count  \n---------\n 2097152\n(1 row)\n\n                                                      QUERY PLAN                                                       \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Aggregate  (cost=50046.40..50046.41 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=623.414..623.414 rows=1 loops=1)\n   ->  Seq Scan on stuff  (cost=0.00..44803.52 rows=2097152 width=0) (actual time=0.017..391.077 rows=2097152 loops=1)\n Total runtime: 623.484 ms\n(3 rows)\n\n\ncount_test=# explain analyze select count(*) from (select 1 from stuff limit 100) as t;\n\n                                                      QUERY PLAN                                                       \n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n Aggregate  (cost=3.39..3.40 rows=1 width=0) (actual time=0.054..0.054 rows=1 loops=1)\n   ->  Limit  (cost=0.00..2.14 rows=100 width=0) (actual time=0.010..0.046 rows=100 loops=1)\n         ->  Seq Scan on stuff  (cost=0.00..44803.52 rows=2097152 width=0) (actual time=0.009..0.024 rows=100 loops=1)\n Total runtime: 0.078 ms\n(4 rows)\n```\n", "created_at": "2011-03-12 14:01:55", "user": 40619, "id": 863607}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/863673", "text": "Also as a quick note, in the patch, no subquery is generated unless there's a :limit or :offset on the relation, so there is no penalty to existing code that is not passing :limit or :offset.  relation.except(:limit, :offset).count will result in the SQL you'd expect.\n\n-john\n", "created_at": "2011-03-12 14:41:57", "user": 40619, "id": 863673}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/874025", "text": "I checked sqlite3 and MySQL and both will shortcut the count of a limited subquery, returning extremely quickly when counting 100 matching rows of a 2 million-row table.

I suspect that characteristic may have contributed to the slowness mentioned on Andrew's database (though a time of 500ms for a scan of 500 rows is still a surprise).  Since Sqlite performs the subquery in its entirety, if the products table has a lot of columns or large TEXT columns, reading and burning that data down to a temporary table would be an expensive process with the \"SELECT *\" from his example.  Andrew's example SQL is not what the patch I submitted generates, though -- my patch performs a simple \"SELECT 1\" inside the subquery (if no column is explicitly requested) or a select on the requested column if it is.\n\nAndrew, does this address your concerns?  I'd be glad to do more research if there's an angle I'm overlooking.

This is a kind of subquery that may not be philosophically in line with relational algebra, so maybe that's not a bad thing.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Rails pluralizes 'virus' as 'viri' and 'octopus' as 'octopi', while pluralizing 'radius' as 'radiuses' and 'alumnus' as 'alumnuses'. Normal usage is generally the opposite - 'radius' and 'alumnus' are generally treated as exceptions whereas other words ending in '-us' are pluralized '-uses'.\n\nThe two exceptions to this currently covered by Rails are unfortunate since:\n- Octopus is a Latinization of the Greek ·ΩÄŒ∫œÑœéœÄŒøœÖœÇ (Octopous), which pluralizes to ·ΩÄŒ∫œÑœéœÄŒøŒ¥ŒµœÇ (Octopodes). The plural 'octopi' is a neologism, and probably originated as either a joke or a misconception.\n- There are no attestations of 'viri' being used as the plural of 'virus' in a Latin text. This is not particularly surprising, given that the first known use of the latin 'virus' is in the late 14th century, long after Latin ceased to be a native language and not long before it ceased to be used even for academic writing. There _is_ a Latin plural 'viri', but it's of the singular 'vir', meaning 'man'.\n\nWhile I'm on a roll explaining a pull request with a pedantic screed, there are various references below.\n- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plural_form_of_words_ending_in_-us\n- http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=virus\n- http://linuxmafia.com/~rick/faq/plural-of-virus.html\n- Fowler, _A Dictionary of Modern English Usage_, p. 684 ([Google Books link](http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Z4HI0RQIDK0C&pg=PA684&lpg=PA684&dq=virus+plural+fowler+modern+english+usage&source=bl&ots=wcz_Wz-nLQ&sig=BDQ9RoSDXwsXwjsAVR6dxCVNAng&hl=en&ei=IgaNTdrWOJGbhQe21-W7Dg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=4&ved=0CDAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q&f=false))\n- Finally, the Official Scrabble Words lists 'viruses', but not 'viri' or 'virii'\n\nTest and documentation changes are, of course, included.

I think I like the API you've suggested, but I have a couple questions about it:\n- How would users enable/disable all observers for all models?  This API seems tied to a particular model class.\n- If the `AuditTrail` observer observes multiple models, do you intend for this API to only disable it for `Post` but no other models?\n\nIt's particularly important to me that we keep some kind of API to make it easy to enable/disable all observers.  Here's how I typically use this (I've written similar code in multiple rails projects now):\n- All observers are enabled by default.\n- In a support file loaded by `test_helper.rb` or `spec_helper.rb`, I disable all observers by default.\n- I write unit tests for each observer, that enable the observer being tested just for the duration of the test, and trigger the observer by saving/creating/updating the observed model.\n- I enable all observers for integration tests.\n\nI'm thinking we can do something like:\n\n``` ruby\nActiveRecord::Base.observers.enable :audit_trail\n\nActiveRecord::Base.observers.disable :all\n```\n\nSince class methods are inherited by subclasses in ruby, it could be used the way you suggest, but I'm not sure I'd recommend it for the cases where an observer observes multiple classes, simply because it's ambiguous.\n", "created_at": "2011-04-27 14:36:27", "user": 49391, "id": 1064560}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1064587", "text": "Your interpretation is what I meant.

We've disabled them directly on `Widget`, but enabled _all_ observers on `ORM` at a later point.  It's a bit ambiguous what the behavior should be.\n\n``` ruby\n\nBudget.observers.enable :audit_trail\n\n# ...later\nORM.observers.disable :audit_trail\n```\n\nAgain, it's a bit ambiguous: should `AuditTrail` receive notifications for a `Budget` or not?\n\nBeing able to enable/disable observers at different levels of the model class hierarchy sounds nifty in practice, but I'm concerned about these edge cases where there isn't a clear right answer (to me anyway).\n", "created_at": "2011-04-27 22:36:21", "user": 49391, "id": 1067097}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1067119", "text": "I'd prefer if last call wins.

Note that in `update` and `destroy` we have to return empty hash so that jQuery will understand that the response is correct.

My best guess at why it was named #either? was somewhat similar to #inject ... that it is idiomatic in functional programming, or carries over from some other language or paradigm. But as far as communicating intent goes, it went absolutely over my head. If the point is to ask an object whether it is one of a list of items, then I think foo.one_of?(1, 2, 3) makes a lot more sense to me. Or maybe #either_of? That reads more naturally to me, but I tend to prefer slightly more verbose method names than keeping them super terse, so that may just be a matter of personal preference.\n\nI just spent a few minutes looking over the diff where include? was changed to in? or either?. I have to say, I do like it. I agree with David's comment about it making the important object front and center. The one criticism I have is that by adding these two new methods, you are adding to the body of stuff that programmers have to learn and remember. The distinction between these two methods is sensible to me - #in? is asking about a pre-existing collection, so that's made explicit. #Either? is asking about an abitrary list of objects, so that uses the splat. I remember when I was first getting into Rails, splat arguments caused me a lot of confusion. I'm better off for figuring them out though :)\n\nI guess the question is, is the added expressiveness for seasoned Rails folks worth increasing the burden on beginning Ruby and Rails developers (and of course, whether there really _is_ any added expressiveness, which in my opinion is yes). I‚Äôll leave that up to you to sort out.

Feels pretty natural, and is handy in the same way blank? and present? are. All of the rest just feel wrong.\n\nI think this is because we're trying to solve a nonexistent problem. Someone mentioned earlier how the English language doesn't really have clear one-word negation options here. That's because in English, we would say \"3 is not in the set of 1, 2, 4\". \n\nI think this tells us something, given that only real use for this method is in conditionals, to begin with (including the ternary operator). The rest aren't needed.\n\nWhere we ask \"if object.in?(array)\", the opposite is \"unless object.in?(array)\". If necessary, !object.in?(array) feels pretty natural as well. \n\nThis seems obvious, as we discuss this. blank? was handy given ruby's definition of truthiness, but present? was a welcome addition because negating a \"negative\" (!blank?) method like blank was often less expressive of intent. You don't ask \"is that space still blank?\" as often as you ask \"has it been filled in?\"\n\nSince the English idiom here is to say \"not in\", I think the standard Ruby idioms for negating the condition already complement in? nicely.\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 10:55:56", "user": 14947, "id": 988807}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/989923", "text": "https://github.com/ernie/notty - I'm considering this problem solved.\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 14:54:26", "user": 14947, "id": 989923}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/989949", "text": "@ernie Clever and expressive. :-)\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 14:57:38", "user": 16927, "id": 989949}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/989957", "text": "@ernie clever but expensive.\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 14:58:25", "user": 4912, "id": 989957}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/989963", "text": "@ernie what @sikachu said, putting a regular expression call on Object's method_missing is going to add things up pretty quick\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 14:59:23", "user": 18524, "id": 989963}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/990161", "text": "So, I had a meme generator image here, and it said \"Y U NO RECOGNIZE JOKE?\".

Feels pretty natural, and is handy in the same way blank? and present? are. All of the rest just feel wrong.\n\nI think this is because we're trying to solve a nonexistent problem. Someone mentioned earlier how the English language doesn't really have clear one-word negation options here. That's because in English, we would say \"3 is not in the set of 1, 2, 4\".\n\nI think this tells us something, given that only real use for this method is in conditionals, to begin with (including the ternary operator). The rest aren't needed.\n\nWhere we ask \"if object.in?(array)\", the opposite is \"unless object.in?(array)\". If necessary, !object.in?(array) feels pretty natural as well.\n\nThis seems obvious, as we discuss this. blank? was handy given ruby's definition of truthiness, but present? was a welcome addition because negating a \"negative\" (!blank?) method like blank was often less expressive of intent. You don't ask \"is that space still blank?\" as often as you ask \"has it been filled in?\"\n\nSince the English idiom here is to say \"not in\", I think the standard Ruby idioms for negating the condition already complement in? nicely.\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 20:54:06", "user": 14947, "id": 992055}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/992194", "text": "I like sans, but the object-subject order doesn't fit for this scenario.\n\n<code>items.sans? kitchen_sink</code>\n\nmakes a lot more sense than\n\n<code>kitchen_sink.sans? items</code>\n", "created_at": "2011-04-12 21:22:04", "user": 166528, "id": 992194}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/993414", "text": "I don't understand why are we jumping through so many hoops to avoid using \"not in\"?\n\nIs it really that bad?

Leaving the `:cost` out of the ActiveModel API hides this important clue, discouraging people from learning about why the `:cost` is important.

I have adjusted it in the past, but tbh I'm probably more likely to decrease it so the specs run fast. I would probably only increment the cost if the default in bcrypt-ruby doesn't keep pace. The work to hash the password doubles for every increment, so it's fine as long as the default cost increments every 2 years.\n\nFrom an API design pov, I like the idea of putting a tiny barrier in place to setting the cost. It makes it more like that if someone does change the default they'll be doing it out of necessity and because they understand the trade-offs.

That operator then has to turn around and get the limits for the operator (possibly two method calls).  Then our newly created range object is thrown away and left for the GC to clean up.\n\nWith my implementation, we call one method (`Array#length`) and pass that along with the start of the range to `Array#[]`.  If `Array#[]` returns nil, we create a new array object.  This implementation requires fewer method calls and is nicer to the GC as we don't create extra objects.\n\nTMYK!  :-D\n\n<3<3<3<3<3\n", "created_at": "2011-04-27 16:16:07", "user": 3124, "id": 1065192}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": true}

A better solution may be to extend ActiveSupport to better handle parsing of Strings back into Time given the current (or specified) locale.  From that point ActionView's date/time helpers could be reworked to use something more generic like ActiveRecord::Coders, multiparameter assignment, composed_of, or something like that.

Furthermore, PATCH should be made the default form method when editing existing model records, since 99% of the time, users want to modify an existing record instead of replacing it. In later versions, PUT can be deprecated or mapped to a different action with proper semantics.\n\nThis change should not break browser compatibility since browsers are already using <code>_method</code> param override for PUT; changing that to PATCH should be simple.

This is true, but unless you control both the server and client code, there's no way to enforce this.  The problem is that `update_attributes` only affects mentioned attributes, not all attributes included in the resource representation.  So if a client does a put with a JSON hash like `{ \"name\": \"John Doe\"}` and the resource also contains an `age` attribute, `update_attributes` will leave `age` set to the current value...but the semantics of PUT dictate that it should be a complete replacement, and therefore `age` should be set to nil (or, it is't invalid to let age be nil, the entire change should be rejected with an appropriate status code and explanatory message).\n\nYou can of course work around this, and write a custom `replace` method on your model that sets unmentioned attributes to `nil`, but it would be nice to have better out-of-the-box support in rails itself.  I think we need a `replace_attributes` method as part of the ActiveModel API so that PUT requests can use this.  PATCH requests could then continue to use `update_attributes`.\n\nI think we could add at least come of this functionality without breaking backwards compatibility:\n- Add a `replace_attributes` method to the AM API.\n- Add support for the PATCH method to the router.\n\nThe hard part is finding a way to make the `resource(s)` declaration in the router support routing PATCH to `Controller#update` and PUT to `Controller#replace` without breaking backwards compatibility.

Handling the case of a blank password also prevents an invalid but persisted entity with a SecurePassword to gracefully fail authentication.  That's my reasoning anyway.  Although I guess by that reasoning my patch is indeed too complex - the alternative being to just remove the validates_presence call and properly handle a blank value.  This way a developer can choose whether or not they want to validates_presence or not directly on their model class.

In the specific HAML case, HAML automatically preserves whitespace in textarea tags (so it turns newlines into their respective HTML codes) since indentation obviously shouldn't happen inside textarea content (or rather, the browser eats indentation, but you want the content whitespace to be preserved.) Since you've added a newline to the content, HAML preserves that whitespace and browsers add an additional newline. So every time a form containing one is submitted and an object updated an saved, it gets an extra newline tacked onto the beginning. So the patch is actually causing the reverse problem of the problem it intends to prevent.\n\nExtensions need to be able to access the actual content rather than modified content. And I doubt that a single hash lookup here (even though it's in every tag generated) really causes any measurable performance difference even on high usage apps. Hash lookups are performed in constant time and are in general extremely cheap, and there are lots of other parts of the view generation process (like view contexts for each partial) that cause exponentially higher overhead than a single hash lookup.\n\nIf you want to avoid the hash lookup, we could follow the spec and add newlines to every tag, but I don't think that would be appreciated...\n", "created_at": "2012-03-27 14:51:43", "user": 125331, "id": 4718079}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4718289", "text": "To be fair, just going with the original hash-lookup based patch won't automatically fix HAML, but it will making patching HAML far less dirty (and make it resilient to different versions of Rails with or without this fix.)\n", "created_at": "2012-03-27 15:00:10", "user": 125331, "id": 4718289}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4718341", "text": "By \"far less dirty\" I mean that to patch HAML with Rails the way it currently works, then HAML will have to either check Rails versions or magically divine whether the newline beginning the textarea tag content is actually part of the content or is just part of the tag.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "I have stumbled upon a problem with **Rails 3.0.7** that I have not found a solution for, and to me it seems like a bug. If it's not, please be gentle. :)\n\nMy models contains of a Notification class that are connected to Group and Member via a polymorphic join model called Delivery. The problem is that when I do the following, the Delivery object is saved, but it fails to add the key to the new notification object. \n\n**The flow in the application, for this example is:**\n1.  /members/new\n   Creating a new member\n2.  /members/1/notifications/new\n   Creating a new notification object by creating a notification object, adding the parent member to the members association and then saving the notification object. As I understand the documentation, the Delivery join object should automatically be saved after the notification object has been saved to the database (and an ID is given to the notification object). \n\nAfter saving the notification, the Delivery join object is also saved, but the Delivery table in the database does not contain the id of the newly created notification object:\n\n```\nselect id, notification_id, notifiable_type, notifiable_id from deliveries; \n1|<NULL>|Member|1\n```\n\n**Note:** I worked around the problem by calling _notification.save_ before _notification.members << member_, but this causes my _after_save_ callbacks to run prematurely, before the notification object is in a valid state.\n\n**Example code from my application. Using this code results in the null value in the delivery table.**\n\n```\nclass Notification < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :deliveries, :as => :notifiable\n  has_many :members, :through => :deliveries, :source => :notifiable, :source_type => \"Member\"\n  has_many :groups, :through => :deliveries, :source => :notifiable, :source_type => \"Group\"\nend\n\n class Member < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :deliveries, :as => :notifiable\n  has_many :notifications, :through => :deliveries\nend\n\nclass Delivery < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :notification\n  belongs_to :notifiable, :polymorphic => true\nend\n\n# Group is not really relevant in this example.\nclass Group < ActiveRecord::Base \n  has_many :deliveries, :as => :notifiable\n  has_many :notifications, :through => :deliveries\nend\n\nclass NotificationsController < ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @notification = Notification.new(params[:notification])\n    @member = Member.find(params[:member_id])\n    @notification.members << @member\n\n    respond_to do |format|\n      if @notification.save\n        ...\n      end\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n# Using non-polymorphic join model worked as expected\n\nTrying to identify if the polymorphic association was the origin of the problem, I simplified my model using only a simple non-polymorphic join model. This worked as expected, and the notification_id was set correctly in the delivery table without the need for \"double saving\" the notification object.\n\n```\nselect id, notification_id, member_id from deliveries; \n1|1|1\n```\n\n**Working code, without the many-to-many polymorphic join model:**\n\n```\nclass Notification < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :deliveries\n  has_many :members, :through => :deliveries\nend\n\nclass Member < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :deliveries, :as => :notifiable\n  has_many :notifications, :through => :deliveries\nend\n\nclass Delivery < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :notification\n  belongs_to :member\nend\n\nclass NotificationsController < ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @notification = Notification.new(params[:notification])\n    @member = Member.find(params[:member_id])\n    @notification.members << @member\n\n    respond_to do |format|\n      if @notification.save\n        ...\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n", "labels": [], "number": 403, "updated_at": "2011-05-07 12:41:23", "user": 126700, "closed_at": "2011-05-07 10:28:31", "id": 855289, "title": "Polymorphic has_many through association causes nil in join table", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/403", "created_at": "2011-05-05 20:18:35", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1113862", "text": "I think the only hope of getting this fixed is, if you can attach a some minimum code that we can run locally and reproduce the problem. \n", "created_at": "2011-05-06 22:00:16", "user": 278, "id": 1113862}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1113987", "text": "I created a minimal rails example project with a readme file explaining how to reproduce the problem:\n\ngit://github.com/larsar/rails-issue-403.git\n", "created_at": "2011-05-06 22:31:03", "user": 126700, "id": 1113987}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1115030", "text": "Thanks @larsar and @gnufied.

(I'm not sure why that wasn't done along with the open ticket migration.)\n- Alternatively, Chris Mear has used the Lighthouse API to [archive all of the Rails Lighthouse tickets as XML files](https://github.com/chrismear/rails-lighthouse-archive), such that a static website can be generated from them. \n\nOf course, we need to get to a point where one can search for a Rails Lighthouse ticket ID that appears in a commit message, or for a Lighthouse ticket URL that appears in a comment in one's codebase, and find the old discussion around that ticket.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Hello,\n\nI hope I can explain this correctly but I ran into an issue with 3.0.7 (not sure about earlier versions) while upgrading my 2.3.8 application. I use activerecord db session storage. It took awhile to track down but I have a javascript observer in the view calling a controller method and somewhere in that transaction my session hash becomes nil. It also deletes the session from the sessions table in the db.\n\nThe controller has a before_filter that calls an authorize method in the application controller and before it reaches that method the session is punted. If I add an exception to the before_filter to ignore the method the observer is calling the session remains intact.\n\nHere's the javascript...\n\n<script>\n        document.observe(\"dom:loaded\", function() {\n            $('time_job_type').observe('change', new Ajax.Request('/time_sheets/set_collection?job_type=' + $('time_job_type').value));\n        }); \n</script>\n\n\nand here's the before_filter with the exception I had to add to get it to not punt my session...\n\nbefore_filter :authorize, :except => [:set_collection]\n\nI suspect the before_filter but If I'm making a grave organizational/programming error in how I'm implementing this I'm ready to be corrected by the experts.\n\nThanks,\n\nChris\n", "labels": [], "number": 421, "updated_at": "2011-05-09 15:36:32", "user": 208661, "closed_at": "2011-05-06 19:29:35", "id": 859743, "title": "Ajax request / before_filter session punting", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/421", "created_at": "2011-05-06 18:31:48", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1112897", "text": "The point is that we need more information to reproduce the issue, if not, there is nothing we can do.

Unfortunately the rails core team is not large enough to have the man power required to tease out the particular details of your issue.  I think the best course of action for you is to:\n1. Send an email to the [ruby on rails mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk).  People there can help you identify the problem.\n2. Once you've identified the problem, file a bug report that contains detailed reproduction steps.  This may even go so far as to create a new application.

I understand what you're saying, but I do not think they override the need to correctly implement Rails _and_ encourage users to use it according to HTTP specs.\n\nFirst, adherence to the HTTP spec isn't \"religious\" but practical and common sense. Letting Rails be a proper citizen of the HTTP ecosystem will help the platform inter-operate better with caches, proxies, browsers, and other HTTP clients. Refraining from using proper HTTP semantics might cause other problems, such as security issues, that we can't foresee as of now.\n\nAs for saying that changing defaults \"breaks far too much to be worth it\", if we follow your line of argument, we would never be able to move forward. I'm of the opinion that fixing the way 90% of apps use HTTP is worth breaking expectations and documentation, especially since the change is backwards compatible and allows users to override the defaults (just as you suggested, except in reverse).\n\nMost likely, the change would not be a problem since it would come with a clear warning from Rails release notes and documentation.\n\nFinally, Rails is a good instructor and scaffold of how to build proper web apps, and in filling this role, it should itself use proper HTTP semantics. That's why we have \"RESTful\" routes in the first place! :)\n\nI hope this addresses your concerns. With strides in Rails in the proper direction, hopefully we'll have a huge number of applications, documents, and books that refer to proper HTTP semantics.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-09 05:04:25", "user": 7035, "id": 1121231}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1121952", "text": "From what I have noticed, this patch is completely backwards compatible.

I am sorry, but I don't get what you are trying to say or why  are you talking about PostgreSQL. This patch is about getting useful values from `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` or other MySQL functions, which rely on the setting of  time zone of the MySQL RDBMS (`CURRENT_TIMESTAMP()`, `CURRENT_TIME()`, `CURRENT_DATE()`, and `FROM_UNIXTIME()`). \n\nAs I wrote in the first post, the setting of the time zone of the MySQL RDBMS is usually `SYSTEM`, which means, that the time zone is set to whatever the system administrator decided, which will usually be the local time zone  of the place, where the system physically resides.\n\nYou have correctly pointed out, that the values stored by Rails in `datetime` columns are usually in `UTC`.  What you get if you query (from Rails app.) the `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` of any such value?  (Sidenote: `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` function returns an integer value, so no time-related conversion in Rails takes place.) Now is the answer \"that depens, probably something incorrect, because the `UTC` value was interpreted (in MySQL) as a value in `SYSTEM` time zone, which is ... (_something nobody cares, because you are using some hosting abroad_)\".  My intend is to use this patch to set the time zone of my sessions to `UTC` to always get proper values from functions like `UNIX_TIMESTAMP` applied to `datetime` type of values.  If someone is using `config.active_record.default_timezone = :local`, then he'll probably not set his sessions time zone to `UTC`.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-09 23:44:15", "user": 325471, "id": 1127086}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2335034", "text": "I recommend you use a datetime column and the UTC_TIMESTAMP() function instead.\n\nOtherwise, this is such a niche case that I don't think it qualifies for inclusion in main database.yml config.

It would be much less work to namespace the Fixture class in ActiveRecord than to change all of the various references to the Fixture model in our app (and it would allow other Rails users to have 'Fixture' models). I'd be happy to work on a patch to do this, but I wanted to get advice first and make sure that it would be a good way to go. Should I namespace it in the ActiveRecord module? Should I namespace all of the classes in the fixtures.rb file?\n", "labels": [], "number": 439, "updated_at": "2011-12-03 23:28:38", "user": 253454, "closed_at": "2011-05-08 10:31:21", "id": 863147, "title": "ActiveRecord Fixture class (lighthouse issue 6098)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/439", "created_at": "2011-05-07 19:42:23", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1116337", "text": "Here's the last patch from lighthouse:\n\nhttps://gist.github.com/960770\n", "created_at": "2011-05-07 19:45:08", "user": 253454, "id": 1116337}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1116346", "text": "@jasonmichaelroth I completely agree that the Fixture class should be namespaced.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "Hey guys,\n\nI've been thinking that it would be cool to improve flashes in terms of i18n and leveraging convention-over-configuration. It would be great to get some feedback if this is desirable and if you think my line of thought is good before I take a stab at the implementation.\n\nBest to let code talk to see what I mean:\n\n```\n# application_controller.rb\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n  protected\n\n    def set_flash_message(status, options = {})\n      flash_key = status == :success ? :notice : :alert\n      options.reverse_merge!(:scope => :\"flash.#{controller_name}.#{action_name}\")\n      flash[flash_key] = I18n.t(status, options)\n    end\nend\n\n# posts_controller.rb\nclass PostsController < ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @post = Post.new(params[:post])\n\n    if @post.save\n      set_flash_message(:success)\n      redirect_to posts_url\n    else\n      set_flash_message(:failure)\n      render :action => 'new'\n    end\n  end\nend\n\n# en.yml\nen:\n  flash:\n    posts:\n      create:\n        success: Post successfully created.\n        failure: Post could not be created.\n```\n\nThis code is, of course, focused on simplicity. If Rails supported this, I'd like it to look like this:\n\n```\nflash[:notice] = :success # or flash[:notice] = generate_flash(:success)\nredirect_to posts_url, :notice => :success\n```\n\nIn terms of internationalization, we could use something similar to what ActiveModel does for generating error messages, namely provide a line of fallbacks. Something like this:\n\n```\nen:\n  flash:\n    success: Success!\n    failure: Failure!\n\n    create:\n      success: \"%{resource} successfully created.\"\n      failure: \"%{resource} could not be created.\"\n\n    posts:\n      success: \"Post#%{action} successful.\"\n      failure: \"Post#%{action} failed.\"\n\n      create:\n        success: \"Post successfully created.\"\n        failure: \"Post could not be created.\"\n```\n\nIf simple strings are given, Rails should use the current way of just assigning the message as is.\n\nCaveats I can see right now (most likely there are other aspects):\n- We'd need this for both, the redirect form and the classic hash syntax so redirecting/non-redirecting actions can be treated at least similarly.\n- In order to make the flash[:notice] = :success thing work, the implementation would have to be right on the flash hash. Probably the generate_flash is easier, albeit more verbose.\n- The implementation needs to take into account controller namespaces.\n- What else? Am I overlooking something? E.g. cases where controller_name and action_name are set to something else than the current controller and action?\n\nWhat do you think? Is this worth implementing? As I said, I can definitely take a stab ‚Äì I just want to collect some thoughts before I do. :-)\n\nCheers,\n- Clemens\n", "labels": [], "number": 473, "updated_at": "2013-03-22 11:54:25", "user": 3749, "closed_at": "2011-10-09 03:28:08", "id": 873583, "title": "[Feature proposal] Convention over Configuration + i18n for flashes", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/473", "created_at": "2011-05-09 21:23:08", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1126501", "text": "I like the idea as I use it in my own apps.

So here is the scenario from the ticket above:\n\nUser 1 makes a request to asset rails.js.  There is a miss on that asset in the cache so rack-cache persists the response in the cache store with User 1's cookie string in a Set-Cookie header.\n\nUser 2 makes a request to asset rails.js.  Rack-Cache checks the cache store and finds rails.js and returns a response with the Set-Cookie header from User 1.\n\nUser 2's session cookie is now User 1's.\n\nI think this issue was probably caused by us using Sprockets to serve assets, since the request/response call travels all the way down the middleware stack when making a request on a sprocket asset.  So when the original asset response is stored, it has gone through the Session middleware, which sets the Set-Cookie header that gets persisted in the cache by Rack-Cache.\n\nThis fixes the problem, although I'm not sure this is the preferred way you guys will want to fix this:\n\nhttps://github.com/envylabs/rack-cache/commit/56a8893c26ad3d62b2974d5e8b2a6279c3f1264d\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 16:15:51", "user": 534, "id": 1174294}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1180999", "text": "Boo. I can think of a few solutions:\n1. Add an option to rack-cache that would be an array of header names to discard before either writing to the store or serving responses.

Put a piece of middleware directly in front or directly behind rack-cache that deletes user-specific headers like `Set-Cookie`.\n3. Add code to the Rails and/or sprockets asset processing pipeline that disables sessions.\n\nI think there's actually two issues here.\n\nYou probably don't want to Set-Cookie on asset responses to keep response sizes down. I'd say 3) makes a lot of sense for the asset case specifically, regardless of caching.\n\nSeparately, with Rails using rack-cache so heavily for page cache cases, I think it's important that there be some safeguards around not sending back `Set-Cookie` session headers to multiple clients accidentally. We'll need 1) or 2) to address that. I'm up for adding an option to rack-cache. It's a fairly frequent request and having to write custom middleware to filter headers each time is annoying. I can't think of a single case where I'd want to cache `Set-Cookie` response headers.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 19:52:45", "user": 404, "id": 1180999}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1184847", "text": "Thanks guys for finding this out.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "The following is partially related to https://github.com/rails/rails/issues/398 as it also covers a performance issue in PostgreSQLAdapter related to a huge amount of method_missing calls. \n\nThe method PostgreSQLAdapter#select looks like this in Rails 3.0.x:\n\n``` ruby\ndef select(sql, name = nil)\n  fields, rows = select_raw(sql, name)\n  rows.map do |row|\n    Hash[*fields.zip(row).flatten]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis is very a roundabout way of doing the conversion from an array to a hash and it can lead to a memory leak - fields.zip(row) return an array of the form [[\"column_x\", 1], [\"column_y\", 2], ...] which can be directly passed as a parameter to Hash.[], instead of first doing flatten and then using the splat. I suggest it is thus changed to:\n\n``` ruby\ndef select(sql, name = nil)\n  fields, rows = select_raw(sql, name)\n  rows.map do |row|\n    Hash[fields.zip(row)]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis version is obviously faster to some degree, but under Ruby 1.9.2 the difference is much larger than one would maybe expect. The reason for this is that the former version causes a surprising side-effect - it calls to_ary on a nil object, which triggers method_missing and all this stuff from whiny_nil.rb and considering how frequently all this happens, it results in an additional major performance penalty. If I augment method_missing in nil_class.rb to display every case of method_missing, I get something like this:\n\n``` ruby\nruby-1.9.2-p180 :005 > Hash[*[[1,2],[3,4]].flatten]\nnil to_ary []\n/home/ruby/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p180@owl/gems/activesupport-3.0.6/lib/active_support/whiny_nil.rb:47:in `method_missing'\n/home/ruby/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/irb/ruby-lex.rb:800:in `identify_identifier'\n/home/ruby/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/irb/ruby-lex.rb:731:in `block in lex_int2'\n/home/ruby/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/irb/slex.rb:236:in `call'\n/home/ruby/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/irb/slex.rb:236:in `match_io'\n/home/ruby/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p180/lib/ruby/1.9.1/irb/slex.rb:75:in `match'\n...\n```\n\nMeaning that to_ary was called on nil with no arguments.

June 1999. Says _Obsoletes: 2068_ at the top.\n\nThe reference to PATCH at the end says:\n\n> The PATCH, LINK, UNLINK methods were defined but not commonly implemented in previous versions of this specification.

Ultimately, the methods should be chosen by the origin server and communicated somehow to the client via the media type or relationship processing rules. If the choice of method doesn‚Äôt make any difference to the other components (i.e., neither client nor intermediaries gain any value by using PUT or PATCH over POST), then we should admit that it just doesn‚Äôt matter to the architectural style.\n\nSo it sounds like we can be pretty RESTful without PATCH, and especially without PATCH as the default.\n", "created_at": "2011-11-16 14:47:21", "user": 4126, "id": 2760124}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/2760198", "text": "> I was referring to the broken behavior of PUT in Rails, not the absence of PATCH.\n\nAbout this point, in what sense is Rails behavior broken? Rails does what is in its hands to let you use PUT in an easy way, even imitating the correct way of doing things in browsers where that's not possible.\n\nThe user is responsible for using those tools correctly. You are free to define as many ad-hoc resources as you want to speak proper HTTP.

The PUT method is already defined to overwrite a resource with a complete new body, and cannot be reused to do partial changes.\"</blockquote>\n\n\n@fxn - I'm sorry I think you're mistaken here and I have to respectfully disagree with you. First of all RFC5789 is not HTTP, let's instead look at RFC2616\n\n<blockquote>\"The PUT method requests that the enclosed entity be stored under the supplied Request-URI. If the Request-URI refers to an already existing resource, the enclosed entity SHOULD be considered as a modified version of the one residing on the origin server. If the Request-URI does not point to an existing resource, and that URI is capable of being defined as a new resource by the requesting user agent, the origin server can create the resource with that URI.\"</blockquote>\n\n\nThe word replace does not appear at all, in fact if you continue to read on you see **\"HTTP/1.1 does not define how a PUT method affects the state of an origin server.\"** This implies to me that there server is free to choose whether to replace the resource in it's entirety or apply the enclosed entity as a patch. It's as clear as day as far as HTTP 1.1 is concerned and putting aside my view own personal views, neither of these outcomes are incorrect.\n\nI think the only reason RFC5789 exists is that the authors have misinterpreted RFC2616. There is simply no language in RFC2616 that mandates \"The existing HTTP PUT method only allow a complete replacement of a document.\" or that \"The PUT method is already defined to overwrite a resource with a complete new body, and cannot be reused to do partial changes.\" It's simply not there. There maybe an argument that \"a new method is necessary to improve interoperability and prevent errors.\" I don't know.\n\nI also don't see how PUT breaks caching? As far as I understand it a successful PUT invalidates the caches for that given URI but the request response itself is not allowed to be cached as per HTTP 1.1. Maybe someone would be kind enough to explain that for me.\n\nHaving said all of the above, it would be nice if someone could actually refute my point to my satisfaction, which you have not done so far.

But yes, that's an hypothesis.\n\nI was for a while in rest-discuss and my feeling is that there's consensus about that interpretation of PUT. Also O'Reilly's book about REST is clear. What's a modified version of the resource? Resources in HTTP are not partial, they are resources, all or nothing, in my understanding of the terminology. You can only request and submit resources or resource representations. So in that sense I believe no verb can work with partial resources. That's where ad-hoc resources come to play, like the paid flag of an invoice in my example above.\n\nBut this thread is pulling in different directions. It's interesting. There's the objections about whether it is premature to support such a RFC because of its status. There's the objections about whether using PUT for partial updates is incorrect at all. There's the argument that Rails should be pioneer and push. Then there will be practical issues because web servers and proxies won't understand PATCH in the short term and we will only be able to tunnel it through POST.\n\nAll in all, I've written to Roy Fielding to ask for advice.

I think it's a serious stretch to compare this to IE6.\n\n@mikekelly: I don't think it's a matter of \"real negative consequences\"; rather, there are very, very positive benefits to implementing PUT correctly that are simply _impossible_ to achieve when the server is not following proper PUT semantics.  I've got a recent internal HTTP service that I built with sinatra and it was very easy to get proper PUT semantics.  The app uses PUT both for create and update, and only allows full representations to be used.  Here are some of the benefits we've received:\n- Since PUTs are idempotent, they can be re-tried as many times as you want. We rely on this a lot. The service is consumed by our main rails app. The rails app performs the PUT to the sinatra service using a resque job, and it's very easy to retry the job when we have a transient failure. It _just works_.\n- The fact that we use PUT for both create and update makes the client code exceptionally simple. We don't need to deal with two separate types of requests to ensure the sinatra service has the resource in the proper state. We just use a PUT, and it doesn't matter if the resource exists or not, or whether or not the resource is already in the desired state; the end result is the same.  We also leverage this in a cron job that runs every few days for the express purpose of reconciling any discrepancies between the user configuration data in the rails app and the data in the sinatra app.  It goes over every user, does a GET to the sinatra app to get the data, compares the data to what it has locally, and does a PUT if there is a discrepancy or if the sinatra app responds with 404 not found.  Again, the idempotent, create-or-update nature of the PUT makes this extremely easy. \n- The fact that we use PUT for create (and thus allow the client to pick the identifier) makes the service very transparent and easy to troubleshoot.  When one of the users of the rails app has some missing data I don't have to go look up the id of the corresponding record in the sinatra service; I can easily construct URLs directly in my browser using the user ID I already know.\n\nNone of these benefits would be possible if we had implemented the normal rails PUT semantics in our sinatra service.\n\nSo here's my two cents (not that anyone asked for it....).  I'd love to see rails provide support to easily implement proper PUT semantics.  As part of this, some other HTTP verb should be used for partial updates. PATCH looks interesting, but POST can be used today and is the correct verb to use.  In addition, it would be great if ActiveRecord/ActiveModel provided an `replace_attributes` method that only supported FULL updates and no partial updates.  It would effectively be like `update_attributes` except that it would set any unmentioned attributes to `nil`.  Most of the time, this would cause the partial update to fail with validation errors, which is the correct behavior you would usually want.\n", "created_at": "2011-12-16 04:17:07", "user": 49391, "id": 3173106}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3175156", "text": "@myronmarston right, this is a common approach e.g. Riak uses it\n\nThe issue here is that your application doesn't rely on completeness being guaranteed for PUT across the web; it's an over-specification of HTTP.

With how I've implemented PUT, the client assumes no knowledge of what state the resource is in on the server.  It simply doesn't matter.  It always PUTs the entire resource.\n\nLikewise, the server doesn't need to know if the request body is intended to be a partial or full representation; it uniformly treats it as a complete resource.\n\nIt makes for simpler, more maintainable code all around.\n", "created_at": "2011-12-16 18:27:34", "user": 49391, "id": 3180791}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3181362", "text": "@myronmarston excellent, thanks.\n\nSo in your case the application is designed that way.

This opens the door to endless controversy because it does not follow from the spec crystal clear that you cannot do it. But Roy Fielding says you should send full representations. If you want an authoritative answer, Roy's the one. Thus, if Rails as a framework has to take sides, I think the most sensible choice is agreeing that partial updates via PUT are not the way to go.\n\nThat does not mean the path to address that in Rails is to support PATCH, but at least I believe we have a sensible conclusion about this.\n\nDoes anybody disagree?\n", "created_at": "2011-12-16 19:14:28", "user": 3387, "id": 3181362}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3182116", "text": "@fxn I agree PUT should not be used for partial updates.\n\nPATCH sounds like the perfect solution for this (in fact, designed specifically for this purpose).

That's obviously longer-term and out of the scope of this pull request. However, this is a good start. I think the _correct_ option as far as this pull request goes is this:\n\n1) Add two new actions: patch and upsert. The update action should match to POST, the patch to PATCH, and upsert to PUT.\n2) Start off with having this as a configuration option, ActionController.update_verb, which is set to :post in new rails apps, but has a default of :put so that old apps still work.\n3) In Rails+1, change the default to :post but leave the option so that people can set it if they still don't want to update.\n\n'upsert' isn't a great name.

It supports updates of the full representation, but it also supports partial updates, which, as we've discussed above, is a violation of PUT semantics (at least in the mind of Fielding and other HTTP experts).\n- `update_attributes` also supports non-idempotent updates when used in combination w/ `accepts_nested_attributes_for`.\n- I think the simplest way to provide an update method that does provide proper PUT semantics is a new method, `replace_attributes`.  It would set any attribute that is not included in the hash to `nil`, and thus treat the given attribute hash as the full resource.\n\nWould the rails core team by interested in the addition of this API?

Remember that different actors in the system (for example user and admin) may see the same model as two different resources where PUT would behave differently for each. Even without those actors, a single model may be exposed as two different resources or vice-versa.\n\nIn other words, `replace_attributes` (or anything like that) would be a poor fit and ultimately lead to poorly designed APIs as people would believe that a call to `replace_attributes` would be everything you would need to have proper PUT semantics.\n", "created_at": "2011-12-22 06:21:37", "user": 9582, "id": 3245941}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3246101", "text": "You bring up good points, @josevalim.

I mean, devs usually call a model into a variable (normally in the controlle's show method), but they might as well make a mix of some related models to represent the resource that they want to expose. In this second case, they then have to rip the params off in the update action, so that they get the different models to validate and save and so on. That's what I see as a weak part of the framework. I feel that josevalim's argument could backing up a kind of \"presenters-and-back\" as a best way to translate/map models into resources, and that the implementation of such a paradigm into Rails should be seriously weighted. Were they dismissed (which I suppose, for that is a whole subject in itself), I would then come to my conclusion: **I dislike disregarding a new method called `replace_resource`** , which sets all empty attributes to nil (or blank, depending on validation rules), supposed that it gets applied on a single model. You can afterwards put all needed warnings in the documentation about the semantic meaning of it. I mean, Rails 4 is going to promote a new verb just to adhere to standards, without any appreciable gain in the short term, just for the sake of it? Do you really mean that you are going to leave devs on their own, having to understand why to use this or that, without further help? _\"Boy, if you want to make proper use of this new feature that we advocate, you'll have to write your own methods for it, it's just 30LOC, boy. After all, Rails is just a framework, don't expect too much from us.\"_\n\nSee my point?

Since the assumption is that memberships should be unique (:uniq => true), the Person object should only have one membership and thus should only have one renewal_date to compare against. The intent is pretty explicit in this case and thus I feel AR can make the solid assumption that there won't be ambiguity amongst multiple membership objects.\n> \n> I think this ticket should be re-opened and solved because I'm pretty sure this behavior works (magically) in MySQL with this exact syntax, so Postgres should behave the same.\n> \n> The only work around I've found for this has been to eliminate the :uniq property and specify:\n> \n> :select => 'DISTINCT people.*, memberships.renewal_date', :order => \"memberships.renewal_date ASC\"\n> \n> which is not a full solution because with :uniq disabled, multiple memberships objects can get created.\n> \n> Since my app is heavily JSON based, I've resorted to crafting the JSON instead of trying to hack AR. The end result is more queries, but I had to solve it somehow. :)\n> \n> +1000 to testing this patch and pulling it in if it works!\n\nHere is the original issue:\n\n> A has_many :through association with an :order option generates SQL which causes PostgreSQL (and possibly others) to report the error:\n> \n> PGError: ERROR: for SELECT DISTINCT, ORDER BY expressions must appear in select list\n> \n> Take the following example model:\n> \n> ``` ruby\n> class Group < ActiveRecord::Base\n>   has_many :memberships\n>   has_many :people, :through => :memberships, :order => \"memberships.renewal_date\", :uniq => true\n> end\n> ```\n> \n> I then load a fixture for some People and the Group with id=1. Using the console, I can run:\n> \n> Group.find(1).people\n> \n> Which results in the following SQL being generated:\n> \n> ``` sql\n> SELECT DISTINCT \"people\".* FROM \"people\" INNER JOIN memberships ON people.id = memberships.person_id WHERE ((\"memberships\".group_id = 1)) ORDER BY memberships.renewal_date\n> ```\n> \n> The \"memberships.renewal_date\" column does not appear in the SELECT field list and thus causes the error.\n> \n> The attached diff appears to fix the issue.

There could realistically be multiple memberships all referencing the same `Person` object.\n\nIt works under mysql because mysql chooses to make an assumption.

Executing a `uniq` at this point makes perfect sense for ids, since you don't want duplicates under any situation (that I can think of). I think the problem is that `uniq` has been reimplemented for relations to generate a `DISTINCT` query, which wasn't expected at the time this code was written.\n\nMoving the `uniq` after `pluck(column)` seems to fix my issue, but I don't know if it won't cause performance issues or if we can't do something cleverer here.

So the above would become:\n\n``` sql\nUPDATE `comments` SET `trashed` = 1\nWHERE `comments`.`id` IN (\n  SELECT `comments`.`id`\n  FROM `comments`\n  INNER JOIN `todos` ON `comments`.`todo_id` = `todos`.`id`\n  WHERE `comments`.`trashed` = 0 AND `todos`.`trashed` = 0 AND `todos`.`todolist_id` = 968316918\n) ORDER BY created_at\n```\n\nHopefully I will return to this when 3.1 is out.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-13 18:50:39", "user": 1979, "id": 1155762}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1282267", "text": "@daicoden and I at @square were pairing on this and we were able to put something together along the lines of:\n\nUnfortunately we are still on 2.3.11.\n\n```\nclass Comment\n  class << self\n    def trash_all\n      sql = \"UPDATE #{quoted_table_name} \"\n      add_joins!(sql, {})\n      sql << \"SET #{sanitize_sql_for_assignment({:trashed => true})} \"\n      add_conditions!(sql, {})\n      connection.execute(sql)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nNow you can call todolist.comments(:conditions => {:trashed => false}).trash_all\nThis results in the following SQL:\n\n```\nUPDATE `comments` INNER JOIN `todos` ON `todos`.id = `comments`.todo_id SET `trashed` = 1 WHERE (`comments`.`trashed` = 0 AND `todos`.`todolist_id` = 968316918) \n```\n\nHope this helps!\n", "created_at": "2011-06-02 17:59:09", "user": 22493, "id": 1282267}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1369903", "text": "Came across the same issue and found the following solution here (http://wiseleyb.tumblr.com/post/3112570940/default-scope-and-update-all-dont-play-nicely) if its of any help in fixing the bug or anyone looking for just a quick interim solution.

This appears to be a defect caused by the Ruby implementation of the Date class.  \n\nThe coercion of Infinity to a date raises the following exceptions:\n\nruby-1.8.7-p334 :016 > x = 1.0/0\n => Infinity \nruby-1.8.7-p334 :017 > x.to_date\nNoMethodError: undefined method `to_date' for Infinity:Float\n        from (irb):17\nruby-1.8.7-p334 :018 > y = -1.0/0\n => -Infinity \nruby-1.8.7-p334 :019 > y.to_date\nNoMethodError: undefined method`to_date' for -Infinity:Float\n        from (irb):19\n\nSince these are distinctively related to infinity values it seems reasonable that one could trap them and override the exception by assigning 1.0/0 and -1.0/0 to the receiver instead.  The effect of this is consistent with current behaviour inside Rails\n\nruby-1.8.7-p334 :003 > x = \"19920101000000\".to_date\n => Wed, 01 Jan 1992 \nruby-1.8.7-p334 :004 > x.class\n => Date \nruby-1.8.7-p334 :005 > x < 1\n => false \nruby-1.8.7-p334 :006 > x < 1.0/0\n => true \nruby-1.8.7-p334 :007 > x < -1.0/0\n => false \n\nInfinity and -Infinity are acceptable values for timestamp columns in current versions of PostgreSQl.  Evidence suggests that the pg gem handles this.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "This bug causes cached asset responses to be invalid after two successful requests. This means that with ActionController caching enabled in production, assets will not be returned correctly to clients. To us, this seems to be an RC-stopping issue.\n\nIn the Rails 3.1.0.beta1, using:\n- rails (3.1.0.beta1)\n- rack (1.3.0.beta)\n- rack-cache (1.0.1)\n\nThere is a reproducible bug when ActionController caching is enabled (in production), where `ActionDispatch::RailsMetaStore`, along with `ActiveSupport::Cache::MemoryStore`, will ultimately cause `Rack::Cache` to return an `HTTP 0` (invalid!) response to Rack.\n\nThe implementation of Rack::Cache works by storing hashes into the cache to retrieve on future requests. Those hashes are written and pulled as necessary for invalidation.\n\nThe basic lifecycle looks like this:\n1. First request, cache empty, find file, generate fingerprint, append to file name, store request response hash information to cache, serve content back to client with a miss, store header response on the cache,\n2. Second request, identify matching file request based on name and fingerprint, read from cache, read and drop the `X-Status` header from the cached hash and return that hash forward to Rack.\n3. Third request, identify matching file request based on name and fingerprint, read from cache, read and drop the `X-Status` header (except it's already been DELETED!), find no status, return HTTP 0 to rack.\n4. All subsequent matches follow #3.\n\nSo, it seems to be that because the MemoryStore cache is handing back the hash object directly, Rack::Cache is then manipulating it before handing it upstream to Rack. In most cases, that's fine, except that because MemoryStore is handing back the actual object, and Rack::Cache is manipulating it, the cache object is ultimately, unknowingly being manipulated. So, subsequent finds are returning the \"bad\" object.\n", "labels": [], "number": 545, "updated_at": "2012-02-28 13:24:55", "user": 3775, "closed_at": "2011-05-17 21:33:53", "id": 895581, "title": "ActionDispatch::RailsMetaStore returns corrupt Rack responses with MemoryStore", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/545", "created_at": "2011-05-13 15:36:13", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1155022", "text": "So a _quick_ fix for this in one of our applications is to run [a modified version of Rack::Cache](https://github.com/envylabs/rack-cache/commit/503973cda8dd3928c8255cff0576af7e1789436c) which removes the deletion call on `X-Status`.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "When writing integration tests, it would be preferable if url generation automatically made use of default_url_options as specified in ApplicationController.

This makes it impossible (or at least extremely awkward) to run integration tests when using a scope with a parameter in it.\n\nHere's a simplified use case:\n1. in routes.rb: \n   \n   ```\n   scope ':path_prefix' do \n     resources :foos \n   end \n   ```\n2. in application_controller.rb \n   \n   ```\n   def default_url_options \n     { :path_prefix => 'test' } \n   end \n   ```\n   \n   foos_path will now resolve to /test/foos when referenced within controllers and views.\n3. in test/integration/prefix_test.rb: \n   \n   ```\n   require 'test_helper' \n   class PrefixTest < ActionDispatch::IntegrationTest \n     test \"path prefix\" do \n       foos_path \n     end \n   end \n   ```\n4.

If a new design is considered, I would suggest the following: since `utf8_enforcer_tag` is applied at the form level, it makes sense to allow it to be overridden in a way that is form-specific.\n", "created_at": "2013-04-17 02:08:16", "user": 3094, "id": 16483122}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": true}

I looked at using constant.constants.member? but it's unbearably slow. Therefore the technique in Fredrick's patch is about as good as it'll get and it results in about a 33% slowdown for a constant like ActiveSupport::Routing::Mapper.

In fact, this \"magic method\" solution I came up with could easily be an ActiveRecord::Base class method (much like \"serialize\" or \"attr_protected\", etc.) to define a list of attributes that are deemed serializable.\n\nFirst I overrode the \"serializable_attribute_names\" method in ActiveRecord::Serialization::Serializer class:\n\n``` ruby\nmodule ActiveRecord\n  module Serialization\n    class Serializer\n      def serializable_attribute_names\n        attribute_names = @record.respond_to?(:serializable_attributes) ? @record.serializable_attributes : @record.attribute_names\n\n        if options[:only]\n          options.delete(:except)\n          attribute_names = attribute_names & Array(options[:only]).collect { |n| n.to_s }\n        else\n          options[:except] = Array(options[:except]) | Array(@record.class.inheritance_column)\n          attribute_names = attribute_names - options[:except].collect { |n| n.to_s }\n        end\n\n        attribute_names\n      end\n    end # class Serializer\n  end # module Serialization\nend # module ActiveRecord\n```\n\nNotice the change in the first line of the method, where I check to see if an ActiveRecord responds to \"serializable_attributes\".  If it does, I take the resulting array of attributes from that rather than the \"attribute_names\" method.  This can be the method we implement in our models:\n\n``` ruby\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n  def serializable_attributes\n    # return array of attributes names we deem are safe to serialize\n    attribute_names - [\"secret_key\"]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nAnd Viola!, the net effect we wanted from overriding as_json...only now we are also compatible with XML serialization.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:54:34", "user": 789801, "id": 1168579}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168580", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Seth Ladd** - 2009-10-13 05:24:17 UTC\n\nFWIW this is still a problem in Rails 2.3.4.

See my solution above - I just overwrote the function that determines what attributes are serializable in ActiveSupport::Serialization::Serializer, and you can add a public method to your models that can return an array of (String) attribute names that can be serialized.  This is a fix for both JSON and XML serialization.  Of course, this solution doesn't allow for ad hoc decisions on what attributes to serialize when using \"include\", but it at least makes sure \"private\" attributes aren't ever included in serialization.\n\nMy suggestion (until \"include\" will accept attributes to include/exclude for child attributes) is to include a method rather than your ActiveRecord relationship that returns particular attributes of your relationship, and can in turn nest deep into the AR relationship tree.  It's not a good solution, it's just a workable solution.  The moment you have 3 or more \"special methods\" because you want different attributes in 3 different situations, you will start to taste vomit in your mouth (I know I would).  Until there is an elegant/incorporated solution (which we can certainly roll ourselves and submit as a patch), I've given the above solution to at least be able to exclude secret or unnecessary attributes from our models during serialization (at any level of the \"include\" hierarchy), and have just learned to live with possibly having too much information in my serialized data.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:54:36", "user": 789801, "id": 1168584}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168585", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aaron Gibralter** - 2009-12-11 19:09:29 UTC\n\nAh -- true that works -- I also found this plugin, http://github.com/vigetlabs/serialize_with_options, that seems to preserve the options of included associations; that is, if you use serialize_with_options { } for all your models in the includes.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:54:36", "user": 789801, "id": 1168585}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168586", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-05-04 17:48:33 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/19097)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:54:37", "user": 789801, "id": 1168586}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168587", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **kendall (at kendagriff)** - 2010-11-22 17:38:47 UTC\n\nAlso having this problem in Rails 3.0.3.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:54:37", "user": 789801, "id": 1168587}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168588", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Alex Neth** - 2010-12-16 07:31:01 UTC\n\nBuilding a json api is a bit of a headache because of this bug.\n\nI tried to override as_json in each object class, but this only works when as_json/to_json is called directly on an object, not when it is included in another.\n\n@posts.as_json(:include => :author)\n\nincludes default author properties instead of using the as_json method.\n\nI ended up creating a static property on my objects and using that wherever necessary, which is in some ways a better solution anyway, since not every serialization will require the same attributes.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:54:37", "user": 789801, "id": 1168588}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168589", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **rails** - 2011-03-17 00:00:12 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

Conversions: Attributes <=> Value object <=> Form data\n2. Validation\n\nJeremy raised two problems: using existing classes and assigning instances through the attribute writer. Basically the following:\n\n``` ruby\nclass Artist < ActiveRecord::Base\n  view :date_of_birth, :as => DateDecorator, :decorating => [:day, :month, :year]\nend\n\nartist = Artist.new(:date_of_birth => '24-05-1980')\nartist.date_of_birth += 10.days\n```\n\nFrom what I understand he thought that meant changing the API slightly and have an object do all the conversions:\n\n``` ruby\nview :date_of_birth, :as => ComposedDateAttribute.new(:day, :month, :year)\n```\n\nThe conversion class could look something like this:\n\n``` ruby\nclass ComposedDateAttribute\n  attr_accessor :attributes\n\n  def initialize(*attributes)\n    @attributes = attributes.flatten\n  end\n\n  # Attributes => Value object\n  def instantiate(record)\n    Date.new(*attributes.reverse.map { |attribute| record.send(attribute) })\n  end\n\n  # Value object => Form data\n  def form_value(date)\n    date.strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n  end\n\n  # Form data => Value object\n  def parse(string)\n    Date.parse(string)\n  end\n\n  # Value object => Attributes\n  def attributes(date)\n    [date.year, date.month, date.day]\n  end\n\n  # Validation\n  def valid?(string)\n    string =~ /\\d{4}-\\d{2}-\\d{2}/\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe upside is that you get an _actual_ Date object, the downside is that it looks like crap and becomes even weirder if you want to use the same class as the value object. Maybe I misunderstood Jeremy's intentions?\n\nAs far as I can see this can be solved with the current implementation:\n\n``` ruby\nclass DateDecorator < Date\n\n  # Attributes => Value object\n  def initialize(day, month, year)\n    super(year, month, day)\n  end\n\n  # Value object => Form data\n  def to_s\n    strftime(\"%Y-%m-%d\")\n  end\n\n  # Form data => Value object\n  def self.parse(value)\n    case value\n    when Date\n      new(value.day, value.month, value.year)\n    when CompositeDate\n      value\n    else # Assume it's a String\n      day, month, year = value.scan(/(\\d\\d)-(\\d\\d)-(\\d{4})/).flatten.map { |x| x.to_i }\n      new(day, month, year)\n    end\n  end\n\n  # Value object => Attributes\n  def to_a\n    [day, month, year]\n  end\n\n  # Validation\n  def valid?\n    day != 0 && month != 0 && year != 0\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe upside of this solution is that the class makes sense: it's an actual decorator. The downside is that strict class checking code might break. I guess the method names should change to be more expressive so this use case makes more sense.\n\nFinally, Jeremy says that he \"[doesn't] think it should be the value object's responsibility to understand how it's composed from the database.\" I completely agree, that's why we use a decorator object to sit 'around' the value object to facilitate the conversions.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:55:45", "user": 789801, "id": 1168632}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168633", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2008-12-11 21:45:22 UTC\n\nCombining the value object and it's parse/dump behavior is more confusing to me.

I'm considering a few things now:\n1. Should we add a format method to the view so you also get a formatted_fee accessor?\n2.

Jeremy hits the key point: it factors out the view behavior into a kind of Presenter, but since it also accommodates reversing the Presenter (to parse input) it might be called an attribute agent.  It could allow much of the existing composed_of behavior to remain since the construction of value objects from DB attributes is orthogonal to view behavior (although the :converter option might be merged into these attribute agents).\n\nOnce you've added support for these agents, why not take the next step and instantiate simple agents for EVERY model attribute and eliminate the troublesome call to <attrbute>_before_type_cast by the AR form helper altogether?  My impression is that <attrbute>_before_type_cast has become the de facto presenter for AR attributes and it doesn't feel right.\n\nYou would also expose an ideal entry point for i18n (parsing/presenting of dates, times, floats, etc.).\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:55:48", "user": 789801, "id": 1168639}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168640", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Michael Koziarski** - 2009-06-26 05:11:25 UTC\n\nI can't see a reason to allow configuration for the different methods to be defined.

Oracle has a 1000 term restriction on such clauses, so that you cannot say something like \"WHERE parent_id IN (1,2,3,4 ... 1001)\".  One possible solution is to break it up like this:\n\n\"WHERE (parent_id IN (1,2,3,4,...) OR parent_id IN (1001,1002,...)\".\n\nIt has been proposed that the adapters can supply their \"in clause limit\", and the abstract adapter can just default to return nil if it has no limit.  But the oracle adapter can return 1000.\n\nI searched to make sure this isn't a duplicate ticket first.  Sorry if it is.

But another place where this popped up was a habtm relationship where activerecord performed a join query.  I'm sure you know where this is in the code better than I do.\n\nHowever, another question is how far reaching will you make this fix?  It seems like a lot of work to make this fix complete, as you'd have to at least put it anywhere in activerecord where there's an 'in' clause.  Yikes.  Also, what about when a user does a condition on `:conditions => ['column_name IN (?)', ids]` \n\nI hate oracle.  But this is for a big corporate application the only database they allow is oracle.

I also don't think that it's possible for the oracle adapter to cleanly fix this problem since it's Rails that generates all of this raw SQL. This means that any query that happens to be including more than 1000 associated records fails with this error: \"OCIError: ORA-01795: maximum number of expressions in a list is 1000\".\n\nThe earlier patch fixes this problem, but I'm also unsure if there might be performance implications of constructing the query that way for all other databases. Although, personally, for queries loading 1000s of associations, I'm more concerned with getting actual results than performance.\n\nI'm also attaching an simpler monkey patch that surely has worse performance. The only real benefit is that you can drop this into config/initializers and it only overrides one method to fix things, and it's only triggered if there are more than 1000 items. The earlier patch is a better solution, but I didn't want to maintain fully patched copies of the various methods involved.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:32", "user": 789801, "id": 1168699}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168700", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Nick M** - 2010-01-15 21:24:19 UTC\n\nOops, here's the simpler monkey patch that can be dropped in config/initializers\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:32", "user": 789801, "id": 1168700}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168701", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Steve** - 2010-01-20 17:14:12 UTC\n\nHi Giorgio, \n    I have the same issue and tried your solution and this is not working for me. \nCan you please upload your file /vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/association_preload.rb ?\nbtw, I'm using rails 2.2\n\nThanks\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:33", "user": 789801, "id": 1168701}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168702", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rizwan Reza** - 2010-02-12 12:46:13 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/13645)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:33", "user": 789801, "id": 1168702}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168703", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Student** - 2010-03-04 15:42:55 UTC\n\nI've done a bit of checking.  It seems that the database adapters are not shy about opening ActiveRecord::Base to make changes.  (See, for instance vendor/rails/activerecord/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/mysql_adapter.rb, and gems/activerecord-oracle-adapter-1.0.0.9250/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/oracle_adapter.rb).\n\nThis indicates that the fix should probably be in the oracle adapter.\n\nAlso, while it has been commented that the user should take care of :conditions => {:foos => list_of_ids} themselves, I have problems with this.  If someone is using a plugin, the plugin might well generate the list.  So they have to hack someone else's code.  Furthermore, it is not a fix, but fixes that we need, as every instance would need to be corrected.\n\nNote that ActiveRecord::Base#quote_bound_value does not go through in_or_equals_for_ids, so the wrapper proposed is incomplete.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:33", "user": 789801, "id": 1168703}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168704", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Student** - 2010-03-04 23:25:02 UTC\n\nWell, ...

Employee is the base class, which the Manager and Worker classes extend. A manager has_many workers, and a worker belongs_to a manager. If a new worker is added and its manager_id field references a worker, that worker should be automatically changed to a manager and have the worker added as a child.\n\nIdeally, you'd bind to a before_add event on the has_many association in the Manager class, since the conversion from a worker to manager object has nothing to do with the new worker object. Unfortunately, the relationship doesn't exist on the soon-to-be manager just yet, so the next best thing would be to add it to the before_add on the worker's belongs_to association, but as this issue indicates, this is not possible.\n\nYou'd think you could then put it on the before_save call, but that won't work because the validations will fail as the manager_id points to an as-of-yet unconverted worker object. Putting it on before_validation would work, but if someone called .valid? on the new worker object, it would convert the worker object referenced by manager_id, and that's not right. If the object wasn't saved after that, the validation would have made invalid changes to the database.\n\nI'm currently resorting to an add_worker method on the Worker class which does the conversion and then creates the association. It's unfortunate, mostly because I have to litter my controller's update and create actions to check for a manager_id, strip it out, create/update the object, and then call this add_worker method afterwards.\n\nI can't think of a better way to model this problem, but if you have any suggestions that are more appropriate than using the functionality presented in this issue, I'm all ears.\n\nThanks!\n", "created_at": "2012-01-17 18:54:11", "user": 458253, "id": 3533410}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3650930", "text": "Reopening for discussion. /cc @jonleighton \n", "created_at": "2012-01-25 13:59:38", "user": 9582, "id": 3650930}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3667085", "text": "``` ruby\nclass Post < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :author\n\n  def author=(a)\n    super\n    author_assigned\n  end\n\n  def author_assigned\n    # do some stuff\n  end\nend\n```\n\nDoes this provide a solution?\n", "created_at": "2012-01-26 10:45:18", "user": 1979, "id": 3667085}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3670601", "text": "Unfortunately not, although it's a more elegant solution than putting it on the validation.\n\nFollowing along with my example, if we override the association attribute writer method for the Employee class (like you've done on the Post class above), the type conversion (from Employee to Manager) on the associated object has to occur before the save, or we'll get an AssociationTypeMismatch exception when we save the employee because an employee can only belong to a manager.\n\nIf we do the type conversion as part of the attribute writer method, we have to save it to avoid the aforementioned exception, and if the attribute is updated but never persisted to the database, we could wind up with a recently-converted manager that has no employees.\n\nThe beauty of doing this in a before_add association callback is that we can make (and save) the type conversion of an employee to a manager _in a situation where we are absolutely certain that the relationship that's triggering it is about to be established and saved_. These two operations really need to be part of a transaction since they're useless individually.\n\nFrom a semantic perspective, I believe the before_add callback is the most appropriate place to put this code. As I've mentioned before, the ideal place would be in a before_add on the Manager class' has_many relationship, since this action really relates to house keeping on the associated object, and not on the object we're saving. However, since the Employee object hasn't been converted to a Manager yet, this isn't possible; it has to be done on the Employee class.\n\nI hope that helps clarify my use case. It may not be common, but I still think it's the most elegant approach, and I'm sure there are other situations in which it would be useful.\n", "created_at": "2012-01-26 15:33:06", "user": 458253, "id": 3670601}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3930197", "text": "If I implement this functionality, provided that it's properly tested, will the pull request be accepted?

Just refactored my code to remove a bunch of monkey-patching using :before_add on my associations.  has_many worked a charm, cleaned things up immensely.  has_one blew up with an invalid key on the association and I found my way here.  Use case, for the discussion:\n\nAll models can have files associated with them.  Originally I wrote this with a simple has_many relationship, but found that I kept needing to segment the files to allow grouping of different kinds of files, eg a Hospital could has_many :scanned_pdfs, but also want to has_one :logo.  The elegant solution here was to create a \"group\" parameter on my file models, then set it appropriately in the has_many and has_one association conditions.  Now eg @hospital.logo.build works great, but if I create the file elsewhere and associate it with the hospital, no attribute update is performed and the group is not set correctly.  Having :before_add work on has_one relationships, identical to has_many, would solve this problem in the most correct possible manner, IMHO.\n", "created_at": "2012-05-21 15:13:16", "user": 1086959, "id": 5825090}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5825328", "text": "+1.\nLet's unify these features!\n", "created_at": "2012-05-21 15:23:06", "user": 1063219, "id": 5825328}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/13032744", "text": "+1.\nhas_one should have the callback as has_many has it.\n", "created_at": "2013-02-02 16:12:25", "user": 2457107, "id": 13032744}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/15369673", "text": "+1\n", "created_at": "2013-03-24 21:30:34", "user": 89839, "id": 15369673}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/16060885", "text": "This feature request is stale from a long time so I'm closing this one since we want to use the issues tracker to track issues and pull request.\n\nI suggest to open a pull request or if you want to discuss more send an email to the Rails Core mailing list.\n\nThank you\n", "created_at": "2013-04-08 16:22:21", "user": 47848, "id": 16060885}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/17901328", "text": "It is very much still an issue that should be dealt with.

This parameter, when set to true (default is false), preserves the attributes.\n\n``` ruby\nHash.from_xml(\"<tag attr='val'>content</tag>\", true) #=> {\"tag\"=>{\"content\"=>\"content\", \"attr\"=>\"val\"}}\n```\n\nThe result is not quite as elegant, but is preferred to loss of data in some cases.\n\nFurthermore, if the attribute is \"type\", Rails will by default attempt to typecast the content as such:\n\n``` ruby\nHash.from_xml(\"<tag type='float'>1</tag>\") #=> {\"tag\"=>1.0}\n```\n\nWith the second parameter set to true, the normal behavior will still be retained where possible, but where no match can be found for the type, it will be passed through:\n\n``` ruby\nHash.from_xml(\"<tag type='float'>1</tag>\", true) #=> {\"tag\"=>1.0}\nHash.from_xml(\"<tag type='number'>1</tag>\", true) #=> {\"tag\"=>{\"type\"=>\"number\", \"content\"=>\"1\"}}\n```\n\nMore information about this problem and my solution is available in a writeup on my blog: [Stop Hash.from_xml from Killing XML Attributes](http://in.finitu.de/2008/11/05/stop-hash-from_xml-from-killing-xml-attributes)\n\nAlso included in this patch is a new format for ActiveResource called AttributePreservingXmlFormat in the event that you need ActiveResource to use the improved Hash.from_xml.\n\nIf anyone has a better idea about how to solve this problem, I'd love some feedback.\n", "labels": [], "number": 588, "updated_at": "2015-04-26 04:19:56", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:47", "id": 904170, "title": "Preserve XML Attributes with Hash#from_xml and ActiveResource", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/588", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:47", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168729", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Pratik** - 2009-03-10 11:27:07 UTC\n\nSurely like the idea.

The tuple example you give fits that bill, but only in the case of an attribute. if \"tag\" were a nested resource instead, this would generate a list of hashes which already has a meaning.\n\nI don't love an idea that requires looking at the hash keys themselves, but I think it might be necessary.

This matches with the notion a Hash key's value can be 'primitive'/atomic value (String/etc) or 'complex' (Hash) (or a list of either, i.e. Array).\n\nBut the notion of only handling child Attributes if child Elements exist is seriously flawed.\n\nI'm not too fond of the key name (:content). Would be more accurate to call it :text or :value.\nEven better, to avoid collisions (yes, I've seen XML like <a value='1'>2</a>), how about an option to control the name of the key? ,eg.\nHash.from_xml(xml, :preserve_attributes => true, :text_value_keyname => :content) [or whatever you want to call it]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 02:58:54", "user": 789801, "id": 1168737}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168738", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **howardk** - 2009-08-21 19:18:36 UTC\n\nGah!

It's application-dependent.\n\nMy opinion: writing your app to rely on Rails to spit out XML/JSON automatically in some order (ASCII order?) is a bad idea.  It's not actually part of either the JSON or XML specs to do so.  It's a fragile approach.\n\nI'm not against this patch, but kazhar, I would strongly suggest a different approach for your app.  It is quite likely, since this is NOT a formally-defined behavior for JSON/XML, that sometime in the future a subsequent patch will get applied which will revert this behavior.\n\nJust write a .rxml and spit it out ordered by date.  Or create an ActiveRecord::Base subclass with \"abstract_class = true\" that overrides the to_xml/to_json methods.  Use the Ruby sort method and spit out what you need.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:03:56", "user": 789801, "id": 1168813}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168814", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Eloy Duran** - 2009-02-10 13:31:23 UTC\n\nAlso, I just remembered OrderedHash is a subclass of Hash nowadays, so this probably already works as it should in 2.3.\n(That is, dumping as an unordered hash).\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:03:56", "user": 789801, "id": 1168814}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168815", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-05-04 17:48:39 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/19097)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:03:57", "user": 789801, "id": 1168815}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168816", "text": "Attachments saved to Gist: http://gist.github.com/971609\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:03:57", "user": 789801, "id": 1168816}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

However this causes problems for many reasons:\n- Implementations may not have IRB installed as IRB; for example, in JRuby it's \"jirb\", and I have Ruby 1.9 installed as irb1.9.\n- For implementations with a slower process startup time, this penalizes them. JRuby has to start the JVM twice. On platforms or JVM versions with slow startup, this causes us to be doubly slow.\n- On platforms where exec doesn't actually replace the calling process, this cases two processes to be in memory rather than just the one. This affects JRuby and running any impls on Windows.\n\nThe odd thing is that it doesn't appear that the exec is actually necessary. I'm attaching a patch that simply launches IRB from within the same process. This resolves all issues I list above. It may not be perfect but it should be a good starting point.\n\nFWIW, the reason it works at all in JRuby is because we have long had a hack in \"exec\" logic that if the command being executed is \"irb\" we force it to run in the same JVM. But it's buggy, and we'd like to be able to get rid of that.\n", "labels": [], "number": 597, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:49", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:49", "id": 904190, "title": "script/console execs irb, causes double process-launch and limits other impls", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/597", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:11:32", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168840", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Charles Oliver Nutter** - 2009-02-28 23:58:00 UTC\n\nI just noticed that the script/console script also requires config/boot, which means that the exec is also causing a second load of Rails and the application.

When it compiles the template code it forces a 'ASCII-8bit' encoding, the problem is when the template code has multibyte characters the template code is returned in a 'ASCII-8bit' string and when this string is concat with a 'UTF8' string with multibyte character the exception is raised because the strings between this encodings are only compatible when both only have seven-bit characters.\n\nThis patch is the result of my research for my proposal for end to end encoding support for rails.\nI am working for a patch for erb to resolve this problem.\nThe included patch is quick hack to force the encoding of the template method code to be utf-8.\n#1988 is a duplicate of this bug.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:11:52", "user": 789801, "id": 1168887}, {"reactions": {"+1": [13420273]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1168888", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **crazy_bug (at terletzki)** - 2009-04-06 12:57:49 UTC\n\nHello!\nWe've got the same problem!

It would really make life so much easier.\nIt would also meant that Rails didn't have to 'force_encoding' anything. It would use the natural encoding converter for any string and if people wanted to run in a different encoding they could still specify it on the command-line.\nFor full support it would actually require ASCII-8BIT <=> 'chosen encoding', but UTF-8 would be a great start.\nI know almost nothing about adding encoding converters to Ruby1.9, but this seems like the most forward compatible change.

Yes there is an argument that a category should be able to exist in more than one catalogue and by association a product can also belong in more than one catalogue thus you have a many to many \n\nMany to many joins are cumbersome and are usually avoided in other development environments and used only as a last resort.\n\nThus my interpretation of the HABTM functionality offered by rails was to meet the many to many join requirement and I can and do use has_many :through for quite a few non many to many joins and I was rather surprised to read here that has_many :through is not really for the purpose I thought it was for and this could partly explain the problem I'm having with accepts_nested_attributes as outlined in my ticket.\n\nIf this is the case (and I hope I read the posts wrong) then I have no solution for multi level nested tables that are not a many to many join which seems like totaly madness to me.\n\nIt seems that if I can define table relationships in whatever way I want to define them to meet my customers requirements then functionality such as accepts_nested_attributes and has_many through should work consistently and raise errors if I don't have all the foreign keys defined for a many to many and a \"different\" option should be allowed or accepts_nested_attributes should be intelligent enough to work out that a particular join table being used for a has_many :through is wither a HABTM model or not depending on the foreign keys.\n\nOf course I could have totally misunderstood what I was reading here as a lot of it went straight over the top of my head and I hope that I haven't got this totally wrong.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:00", "user": 789801, "id": 1169003}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169004", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2009-09-11 22:04:35 UTC\n\n[milestone:id#50064 bulk edit command]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:00", "user": 789801, "id": 1169004}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169005", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rizwan Reza** - 2010-05-16 01:41:09 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/20088)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:01", "user": 789801, "id": 1169005}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169006", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-05-23 16:54:42 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/20606)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:02", "user": 789801, "id": 1169006}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169007", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-05-24 08:40:51 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/20631)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:03", "user": 789801, "id": 1169007}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169008", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-05-25 22:45:38 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/20816)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:03", "user": 789801, "id": 1169008}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169009", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-08-30 01:28:48 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/27613)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:14:04", "user": 789801, "id": 1169009}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

I'm not sure whether this is a documentation issue or whether to come up with a patch.\n\nSetting it in environment.rb shouldn't have any detrimental effect in production (I think), so a documentation update would be the easiest fix.

The first association to a certain table keeps the table name.  Further joins with associations to that table use aliases consisting of the association names in the path.\n\nWith the great flexibility of named_scoped, it is increasingly common for app developers not to know about already existing joins at coding time.  Also, the order of joins in a Hash is undefined in Ruby 1.8.\n\nTable aliases are needed, though, for building conditions on the association tables.  With our plugin declarative_authorization, which is using named_scopes to rewrite queries according to permissions, we frequently run into problems because of unpredictable table aliases.\n\nI'd like to propose (and am willing to implement) the following simple API for querying the expected table alias for certain association join path, to be used by app developers\n\n``` ruby\nActiveRecord::Base.table_alias_for(*path)\n\n# Example:\ncompany_alias = User.table_alias_for(:home_branch, :company)\nUser.some_scope.find(:all, \n    :joins      => {:home_branch => :company}, \n    :conditions => [\"#{company_alias}.name LIKE ?\", search])\n```\n\nThe actual algorithm for determining the table alias should work as follows:\n- All joins receive a table alias according to the join path\n- Association names in a path are concatenated into a long alias, i.e. :home_branch, :company => \"home_branch_company\"\n- Aliases exceeding the max alias name length are shortened to (max_length - 9) and concatenated with an underscore and 8 characters from the long alias string hash in hex\n\nI.e.\n\n``` ruby\nlong_alias = join_path * \"_\"\ntable_alias = long_alias[0, max_table_alias_length - 9] + \n    \"_\" + (\"%x\" % long_alias.hash)[0,8]\n```\n\nThoughts?\n", "labels": [], "number": 606, "updated_at": "2015-02-19 16:00:37", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:49", "id": 904214, "title": "Predictable Table Aliases in Joins", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/606", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:05", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169054", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **ronin-38963 (at lighthouseapp)** - 2009-04-25 00:50:26 UTC\n\nThis should definitely be addressed.

So you can do something like this...\n\n``` ruby\nBlah.find(:all,\n  :joins => {:foo => {:bar => {:baz => :foos}}},\n  :conditions => {:foo => {:bar => {:baz => {:foos => {:name => 'Qux'}}}}}\n)\n```\n\n...and the generated SQL will have the correct table alias for `:foos` (probably something like `blahs_foos`).  The conditions can be arbitrarily complex, as long as your attribute and association names are correct and all referenced associations are included in `:joins`.\n\nThis patch doesn't really do what Steffen requested, but it might help some users.  It makes `:conditions` behave in such a way that you don't really need to know the table aliases in the first place.\n\nOf course, if you want to test for anything but equality (like in Steffen's example, using a LIKE), this patch isn't going to help.  I wonder if we could/should get the job done by also amending `find` to make `:conditions` able to handle things other than equality (e.g. like, not_like, between, not_between).\n\n``` ruby\nUser.some_scope.find(:all, \n    :joins      => {:home_branch => :company}, \n    :conditions => {:home_branch => :company => {:name => like {search}}})\n```\n\nPatch attached.  It doesn't include any new tests, but I did make sure that none of the existing ActiveRecord tests broke.

Even if you  added all operators as instance methods to AR (which would introduce quite a lot of noise in the models), you still wouldn't be able to use those when calling find from a controller, for instance.\n\nYou could do something like this, but it is quite a lot of code, I'd say:\n\n``` ruby\nUser.some_scope.find(:all,\n    :conditions => ActiveRecord.condition {\n        {:home_branch => :company => {:name => like {search}}}})\n```\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:07", "user": 789801, "id": 1169056}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169057", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **ronin-38963 (at lighthouseapp)** - 2009-06-06 10:01:25 UTC\n\nI still support strongly Steffen's original report.

I'm running rails 2.3.2, with mysql on mac os x and the problem arose whilst following the prag prog's agile dev with rails book (3rd edition latest release). I change the default session store to use active record, run all the necessary rake tasks to create the sessions migration, run the migration itself and reset the rails mongrel server. Now as soon as an action is called that tries to access the session I receive an InvalidAuthenticityToken error however I can see in my trace that this token is included in the request params. SO... I didn't some hunting around and added the following line to controller the action lies in:\n\nprotect_from_forgery :only => [:create, :update, :destroy]\n\nand while this solves the invalidauthenticitytoken error it doesn't solve the invalidauthenticitytoken error when actions in other controllers are called e.g. create/edit/destroy! so eventually I just overrode the lot by adding this to my development.rb env file:\n\nconfig.action_controller.allow_forgery_protection = false\n\nand this produced some strange results, it seems to create a new session id for each request which I can see whilst monitoring the DB table!\n\ni finally decided to revert to the default cookie store but then started receiving more errors as I filled up the 4kb data limit pretty quickly which is understandable! so this leaves me stumped! is this a problem with the latest rails release or am I completely missing something here?\n\nany help is much appreciated.\n\nkind regards\n\nRichard Delph\n", "labels": [], "number": 608, "updated_at": "2011-05-16 03:24:31", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-16 03:24:31", "id": 904217, "title": "Rails 2.3.2 sessions problem", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/608", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:24", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169076", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Richard Delph** - 2009-04-02 02:38:14 UTC\n\nJust wondering if anyone has encountered the same error as described above when using the active record session store?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:24", "user": 789801, "id": 1169076}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169077", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Richard Delph** - 2009-04-02 03:26:22 UTC\n\nWith the help of someone else who has encountered this error it seems I just needed to comment out the line\n\nprotect_from_forgery\n\nin the application controller and this seemed to have sorted it. though the error still stands with new sessions being created when inserting the line \n\nconfig.action_controller.allow_forgery_protection = false\n\nin the dev environment file...\n\nRich\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:25", "user": 789801, "id": 1169077}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169078", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **ronin-52463 (at lighthouseapp)** - 2009-04-05 08:51:28 UTC\n\nI've had the same problem and didn't find any solution.\n\nI think that disabling protections will go around the problem and not solve it.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:25", "user": 789801, "id": 1169078}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169079", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Tony Pitale** - 2009-05-09 03:06:00 UTC\n\n+1 using anything other than cookie sessions\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:20:25", "user": 789801, "id": 1169079}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169080", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **philip (at packetnode)** - 2009-05-16 06:03:56 UTC\n\n+1 here.

For instance:\n\n```\nvar jsonPostData = {\n   \"_method\": \"put\",\n   \"hash1\": {\n     \"array1\" : [{\n       \"key1\" : \"val\"\n     },{\n       \"key2\" : \"val2\"\n     }]\n   },\n   \"stringVal\" : \"val3\"\n}\n```\n\nThis big structure will automatically be converted into a Ruby hash when it is posted to the controller.\n\nWith Rails 2.3.2, this no longer works.  An error is thrown when the data is posted.\n\nNote that in Rails 2.3, a request submitted \"normally\" with Content-Type set to \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\" works fine.  However, I don't know of a way to convert my highly structured JSON data (example given above) into data that can be submitted in the \"normal\" fashion.  (If someone knows how to do this, please let me know as it would be an acceptable workaround).\n\nAs it stands, we're stuck using Ruby 2.2 until this problem is resolved.\n", "labels": [], "number": 612, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:50", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:50", "id": 904222, "title": "Rails 2.3 JSON \"put\" request routing is broken", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/612", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:21:25", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169135", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **David Burger** - 2009-04-17 01:39:21 UTC\n\nI'm having the same problem.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2521\nCreated by **John Small** - 2010-11-25 12:13:39 UTC\n\nThis is Rails 2.3.2 and going back to 2.2.2\nThe documentation in ActiveResource describes to_xml having the option :dasherize, which defaults to false. But in active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb we have\n\ndef rename_key(key, options = {})\n          camelize = options.has_key?(:camelize) && options[:camelize]\n          dasherize = !options.has_key?(:dasherize) || options[:dasherize]\n          key = key.camelize if camelize\n          dasherize ? key.dasherize : key\n        end\nWhere dasherize is defaulting to true on line  147\n\nThe consequence of this is that ActiveResource#to_xml and #encode both assume it's defaulting to false, when it isn't and so they will replace underscores with hyphens. It's not picked up  in any tests on ActiveResource because the test cases don't use attributes with underscores and don't test to see that the field names aren't changed when you save the record. Hence if you read in an ActiveResource record from an external server not running Rails and the field names have underscores, you can't save it because the field names get changed to have hyphens in the POST data.\n\nProbably the default should leave keys as they are and you have to add the option :dasherize=>true if you want it different. \n\nSolution : remove the ! from !options.has_key?(:dasherize) and do things the same way camelize is done to be consistent. \n\nI couldn't find the test suite for ActiveSupport where is it?\n\nJohn Small\n", "labels": [], "number": 615, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:52", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:52", "id": 904226, "title": "hash#to_xml :dasherize defaults to true", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/615", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:22:27", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169197", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **John Small** - 2009-04-19 16:15:42 UTC\n\nOk, I've found the tests for hash#to_xml added a test to check the default for :dasherize is false, fixed the code and now lots of things all over the place are broken.\n\nIt seems that a lot of code has been written with the expectation that hash#to_xml defaults to :dasherize=>true, even though that's obviously daft, you don't let the default change something unexpectedly, you should let the default leave things as they are. It violates the rule of \"least surprise\". The result is that \n{ :name => \"David\", :street_name => \"Paulina\" }.to_xml contains\n<street-name> and not <street_name>.\n\nAlso the test for dasherize assumes the default for camelize is false (as it should be) but it shouldn't be implied in the test for dasherize. There's no test for camelize == false and no test for a default value for camelize and no test for what should happen if  both camelize and dasherize are set to true.\n\nI can see that hash#to_xml is setup to behave the same way that array#to_xml behaves, that is by default :dasherize=>true, so that when serializing an active record to XML underscores are changed to dashes. Is that a policy decision? That seems odd to me.\n\nActing on the premise of \"least surprise\" sending a record with underscores in the field names to xml and getting <created-at> in the xml when you expect <created_at> would certainly surprise me.\n\nIf it is a policy decision to change field names by default then it needs to be made clear in the documentation and we need to have a way to override the default behavior. \n\nI'll argue with that choice but there's so much code written on the assumption that \"created_at\" becomes <created-at> when XMLized that it will have to be lived with unless there's a way to set it as a class default in RAILS initialization so that by default :dasherize=>false unless you set it to true on in Rails initialization. \n\nCurrently I've got no way to override the default behavior when I save an ActiveResource. This will cause problems in future when Rails starts to be used more for integration with non-Rails systems. At the moment Rails is an island so it doesn't matter much. But this will become known as an annoying \"Rails quirk\" when more people start doing system integration using ActiveResource.\n\nComments please\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:22:27", "user": 789801, "id": 1169197}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169198", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Taryn East** - 2009-04-20 10:51:13 UTC\n\n...no Rails is an island\n\nWe're currently running into this problem right now trying to integrate with another API and it's a right pain to force it to use dashes instead of underscores.\nI'd be happy with just some config option where I can tell ActiveResource to always use underscores, but right now there seems to be no way to do this.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:22:28", "user": 789801, "id": 1169198}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169199", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **John Small** - 2009-04-20 12:04:39 UTC\n\nMmm, well at least I know that it's not just me begin ignorant about some undocumented feature that everyone else knows about.\n\nI've raised this issue in the Rails-Core google group. I've worked out what the fixes are and am ready to push my changes, but there's an awful lot of code out there, and in the Rails test suite that assumes \"created_at\" will become \"created-at\" when converted to XML. It seems daft to me, but it's been in the code for a long time so there might even be a rationale behind it.\n\nI suspect that this is something that's slipped through because there aren't thousands of people using ActiveResource & REST for systems integration. Though I need to find out if it's a policy choice of some sort, the absence of a test for default values makes me think that it's just something no one has thought about.\n\nYou might get a fix in the next few days. If you need the fix right now and don't mind lots of tests in the Rails test suite breaking then go to active_support/core_ext/hash/conversions.rb find def rename_key(key, options = {}) go to line 147 (as it was last night when I cloned the source) then change\n\ndasherize = !options.has_key?(:dasherize) || options[:dasherize]\n\nto\n\ndasherize = options.has_key?(:dasherize) && options[:dasherize]\n\nThat will do the magic required to get your XML api working.

This patch covers\n\n1) Extra tests for the default values of :dasherize and :camelize\n2) Make sure that the tests for each values of :dasherize and :camelize make no assumptions about the default value of the other one. E.g. the tests for :dasherize true and false, set :camelize=>false in the option, and the tests for :camelize true and false set :dasherize=>false in the options.\n\n3) added cattr_accessor for :dasherize_xml and :camelize_xml. In this patch Hash.dasherize_xml = true and Hash.camelize_xml = false to work with existing code.

For users that need the default to be correct, they can set Hash.dasherize_xml = false in an initializer. \n\nBecause the default should be to leave things alone I recommend that in future the default should be changed to Hash.dasherize_xml = false.\n\nBecause Ruby cannot use dashes in attribute names incoming XML with dashes in the tag names must be converted to underscores. But the converse is not true, outbound XML from attributes with underscores in the names does not need to have the underscores converted into dashes. If XML comes in with underscores it should go back out with underscores.\n\nIf you have both dashes and underscores in your XML tags then you're in trouble and this patch won't help.

I've done two with the attributes dasherize_xml and camelize_xml added to ActiveSupport as requested. Then I've done one for edge only with dasherize_xml and camelize_xml on the Hash class. Putting attributes on ActiveSupport, when the attributes are only required for the Hash class doesn't look right to me. \n\nIn 2-3-stable it kind of makes sense because of the way the modules are arranged and the fact that the code in 2-3-stable has Hash as a module contained in the ActiveSupport module.\n\nIn the development since 2-3-stable the modules have been re-arranged and the conversion code for Hash is now attached to the class and as far as I can see the Hash class doesn't live inside the ActiveSupport module. In the code I've had to introduce the ActiveSupport module into conversions.rb, but it sits outside the Hash class. It looks very wrong to me, but maybe it's a Rails convention to do things like that. If so I'd question the convention. \n\nThe patch 2-3-stable_hash_to_xml_patch.diff  is the patch for 2-3-stable (obviously) with mattr_accessors on ActiveSupport\n\nThe patch edge_AS_hash_to_xml_patch.diff is the version for edge with mattr_accessors on ActiveSupport\n\nThe patch edge_hash_to_xml_path.diff is the version for edge with cattr_accessors on Hash\n\nI've removed the extraneous 'begin' from the tests for default values in all variants of the patches.\n\nI'll also start looking at what needs to be done to bring ActiveRecord into line with ActiveResource in .to_xml. It seems the code base between the two has diverged.\n\nThanks for adding this patch. We'll now be able to read-write via REST to non-Rails apps without having to go through XSLT. \n\nCheers\n\nJohn Small\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:22:31", "user": 789801, "id": 1169207}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169208", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Michael Koziarski** - 2009-05-10 01:14:10 UTC\n\nThis went into 2.3 as of 7bf9bf3\n\nMoving the milestone to 3.0.\n\nDo other contributors have any thoughts on the two options here for configuration options for core_ext stuff?\n\n```\n  Hash.dasherize_xml\n```\n\nOR\n\n```\n  ActiveSupport.dasherize_xml\n```\n\nThe second is consistent with other 2-3isms, but for 3.0 and forward do we want to move it?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:22:31", "user": 789801, "id": 1169208}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169209", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **John Small** - 2009-05-10 19:10:01 UTC\n\nI can see the benefit of keeping all the options/attributes for mixins to Ruby core modules that are introduced by ActiveSupport attached to the ActiveSupport module. It makes it very clear that you're altering the behaviour of something that's not part of standard Ruby, but part of something added by ActiveSupport. But I still feel ill about adding an attribute that's intended solely for an extension to Hash to something outside of Hash and which isn't up the inheritance chain. It breaks the idea of encapsulation of object behaviour. As you can see from the code, it looks really weird having to open ActiveSupport inside conversions.rb just to attach some new attributes to the module, and it looks just as weird having to refer to an outside attribute while inside Hash#rename_keys to determine the output. \n\nThere must be other instances like this dotted about in the code and as you mentioned in your post, it's the way things have been done in the past, but it might not be a bright idea for the future. \n\nMaybe something like;-\n\n```\nActiveSupport::CoreExt::HashMixins.dasherize_xml\n```\n\nThat keeps the attribute localised to the mixins added to Hash, and at the same time makes sure that if you set the thing you know you're setting an attribute introduced as part of the ActiveSupport extensions to Ruby core. It would require re-adjusting the modules though, and they've just been through an extensive house cleaning exercise.\n\nI'm all in favour of extremely descriptive variable names even if it requires more typing. I can well see that a few months or years hence someone who hasn't read this conversation will be looking at  \n    Hash.dasherize_xml = false \n\nin someone's code and thinking \"dasherize_xml!? wtf is that?

Now consider these use cases:\n- you want to get the set of NiceSpecialPosts.\n- you want to get the set of SpecialPosts and it's subclasses.\n- you want to get the set of GoalPosts and NiceSpecialPosts.\n\nThese are all terribly inefficient if the polymorphic type does not hold the subclass.\n\nOn the other hand, if the polymorphic type does have the subclass, then queries such as this are possible, e.g. for the second case above:\n@Tags.find(:all, :include => :posts, :conditions => {:posts_type => [SpecialPosts, SpecialPosts.subclasses]})@\n\nIf you can do such a query using @find@ then you can generally achieve the same thing in an association.\n\nApologies if this is all a bit Rails2 - we haven't upgraded yet.  I have actually made these changes to our Rails2 installation and all of our polymorphic associations work this way because it enables queries in ActiveRecord that would otherwise be a pain to write.\n\nAlthough my opinions are based on Rails2, I don't see why this doesn't affect Rails3 - I'd have thought the same use cases could only be solved in the same way in Rails3 too, but the generally approved style and syntax would be different.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:23:19", "user": 789801, "id": 1169251}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169252", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Paul K** - 2011-02-12 04:01:12 UTC\n\nI agree with Jonathan. There are non-trivial performance gains by storing the actual STI class in the polymorphic type column ... effectively removing the need to make extra joins.\n\nI've first stumbled onto this \"problem\" in Rails 1.x and have been applying patches as I've been upgrading Rails. Now I'm looking to upgrade to Rails 3 and oh no ... Rails 3 still stores the base class in polymorphic type columns and no there is no patch :(.\n\nGoing from the existing Rails behavior to what's proposed will require a migration to update the polymorphic columns and simple code changes (i.e. instead of parent_type = 'Person' you need parent_type = [Person, Person.subclasses]).\n\nGoing the other way also requires a migration but the code changes are potentially much more complex as additional joins have to be worked into the code. \n\nBTW, this seems to be same as [#5617](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/5617).

I found two tests for this:\n\n``` ruby\n  def test_counter_cache\n    topic = Topic.create :title => \"Zoom-zoom-zoom\"\n    assert_equal 0, topic[:replies_count]\n\n    reply = Reply.create(:title => \"re: zoom\", :content => \"speedy quick!\")\n    reply.topic = topic\n\n    assert_equal 1, topic.reload[:replies_count]\n    assert_equal 1, topic.replies.size\n\n    topic[:replies_count] = 15\n    assert_equal 15, topic.replies.size\n  end\n\n  def test_custom_counter_cache\n    reply = Reply.create(:title => \"re: zoom\", :content => \"speedy quick!\")\n    assert_equal 0, reply[:replies_count]\n\n    silly = SillyReply.create(:title => \"gaga\", :content => \"boo-boo\")\n    silly.reply = reply\n\n    assert_equal 1, reply.reload[:replies_count]\n    assert_equal 1, reply.replies.size\n\n    reply[:replies_count] = 17\n    assert_equal 17, reply.replies.size\n  end\n\n```\n\nBoth of these pass, of course. Now if you comment out the line that reloads the \"has-many end\" of the association,\n\n``` ruby\n# assert_equal 1, topic.reload[:replies_count]\n```\n\nand\n\n``` ruby\n# assert_equal 1, reply.reload[:replies_count]\n```\n\nthen both of them fail.\n\nNow I guess that the tests serve as specifications, too, so that the collection size should only show the updated value through the counter_cache after a reload.

Given that Rails does automatic time zone conversions when reading and assigning model attributes, you'd expect that it would handle time zone conversions for you in find conditions (I've seen many reports of people being confused by this.)\n\nTo further confuse things, this query _will_ work correctly with default_timezone == :utc:\n\n``` ruby\nArticle.all :conditions => ['posted_at < ?', 1.day.ago]\n```\n\n...but this one won't:\n\n``` ruby\nArticle.all :conditions => ['posted_at < ?', Time.now - 1.day]\n```\n\nThis patch will fix this behavior, so that any time-like object passed in to find conditions will be sent to the database in the appropriate zone.\n\nAnother benefit of this patch: it will allow ActiveRecord time_zone_aware_attributes to be used with default_timezone == :local, a combination that doesn't work correctly right now.

Anyone who's been misusing #to_time up till now will get regressions.\n\nTime.parse already returns results in the local timezone by default, so no issue there - so I'm ok with this, I think people should be using Time.parse instead of String#to_time normally anyway.\n\nBut just wanted to get something in this ticket to help people confused by this breakage - and clarify that this patch doesn't only affect queries, it can also affect attribute writes in the (rare) case where you're parsing strings yourself using #to_time or any other function that returns times in a different timezone to the database timezone (itself rare, since most of us run the database in UTC, making this change have no behavioural impact).\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:37", "user": 789801, "id": 1169374}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169375", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Will Bryant** - 2009-07-27 13:26:43 UTC\n\nAlso, wanted to buy: accurate lighthouse list formatting instructions :|.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169375}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169376", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Geoff Buesing** - 2009-07-28 04:10:55 UTC\n\n@Will -- thanks for the report. Indeed, this change has the potential to break apps that use Time.utc and Time.local objects interchangeably when building find conditions, or, if time_zone_aware_attributes are turned off, assigning to model attributes.\n\nTime#to_s(:db) doesn't do any zone conversion when it reports the time to the database, so you can currently get away with treating Time.utc and Time.local instances interchanegably:\n\n``` ruby\n>> Time.utc(2000).to_s(:db)\n=> \"2000-01-01 00:00:00\"\n>> Time.local(2000).to_s(:db)\n=> \"2000-01-01 00:00:00\"\n```\n\nWith this patch, Time.utc and Time.local report themselves in a zone appropriate manner (I'm adding in a #getutc call to illustrate coercion to default_timezone :utc):\n\n``` ruby\n>> Time.utc(2000).getutc.to_s(:db)\n=> \"2000-01-01 00:00:00\"\n>> Time.local(2000).getutc.to_s(:db)\n=> \"2000-01-01 06:00:00\"\n```\n\n...which is more appropriate behavior, given that these two objects represent different times.

We also patched our copy of Rails to fix it. Initially our patch matched yours, in the quoted_value method.  But we still found it very surprising that\n\n``` ruby\n  Time.now.to_s(:db)\n```\n\nreturned a string in system local time zone whereas\n\n``` ruby\n  Time.zone.now.to_s(:db)\n```\n\nreturned a string in UTC.  This was a problem because we have methods that were using to_s(:db) and counting on the conversion to UTC to happen.  Given Ruby's duck typing, the callers could pass either Time or TimeWithZone and it would appear to work but yield wrong results.\n\nSo we decided to fix this problem at its root:  we patched active_support/core_ext/time/conversions.rb.  Currently in Rails 3.0.3 that reads like:\n\n``` ruby\n  def to_formatted_s(format = :default)\n    if formatter = DATE_FORMATS[format]\n      formatter.respond_to?(:call) ? formatter.call(self).to_s : strftime(formatter)\n    else\n      to_default_s\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nHere it is patched:\n\n``` ruby\n  def to_formatted_s(format = :default)\n    if formatter = DATE_FORMATS[format]\n      instance =\n        if format == :db\n          ActiveRecord::Base.default_timezone == :utc ? dup.utc : dup.localtime # avoid changing self by calling utc or localtime\n        else\n          self\n        end\n      formatter.respond_to?(:call) ? formatter.call(instance).to_s : instance.strftime(formatter)\n    else\n      to_default_s\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nI believe ActiveSupport shouldn't be coupled to ActiveRecord like this, so one last step would be to move that default_time_zone down to ActiveSupport with a pass-through accessor at the ActiveRecord level.\n\nWhat do you think of this approach?  If it looks good I could submit a patch with tests.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:51", "user": 789801, "id": 1169390}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169391", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-12 21:58:20 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/42275)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:52", "user": 789801, "id": 1169391}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169392", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-27 03:15:37 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/43692)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:53", "user": 789801, "id": 1169392}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169393", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Will Bryant** - 2011-04-12 10:51:43 UTC\n\nColin, I agree that passing the timezone setting down from activerecord to activesupport would be a much better approach (if #to_s needs to know about this at all).\n\nActivesupport could/should ship without a :db format at all, and activerecord should add this format using the proc support already present, doing the necessary timezone conversion in the proc before calling the normal strftime.\n\nStill not entirely convinced we need to do all this, since quoted_date and friends are actually used for any query stuff now, but at least it'd unbreak Rails 2 upgraders who have non-UTC databases.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:54", "user": 789801, "id": 1169393}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169394", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Colin Kelley** - 2011-04-12 17:47:49 UTC\n\nWill,\n\n> Activesupport could/should ship without a :db format at all, and activerecord should add this format using the proc support already present, doing the necessary timezone conversion in the proc before calling the normal strftime.\n\nI agree that shipping ActiveSupport without a :db format and then overriding it at the ActiveRecord level would work too.\n\nThe tie-breaker would probably be whether anyone who just uses ActiveSupport finds the :db format useful, or whether very many are using it already.  Both seem like decent possibilities to me.\n\n> Still not entirely convinced we need to do all this, since quoted_date and friends are actually used for any query stuff now, but at least it'd unbreak Rails 2 upgraders who have non-UTC databases.\n\nI think it's important to do _something_ because the current behavior violates the Principle of Least Surprise.  (I believe this principle is critical with duck typing since there is an implicit assumption in duck typing that methods with identical names accept the same parameters with the same calling contracts.  I guess overloading to_s() to take a parameter was already on this ice in this regard.)\n\nImagine a method write_to_file() that takes a timestamp parameter that it writes to the file in :db format.  It's really easy for calling code to be changed from this:\n\n``` ruby\nwrite_to_file(Time.now)\n```\n\nto this:\n\n``` ruby\nwrite_to_file(1.second.ago) # timestamp should always be in the past\n```\n\nHow many would realize they just changed the parameter type from a Time to a TimeWithZone?\n\nCurrently making the change above causes time zone to shift unexpectedly, which you can't directly tell since the time zone is not included in the :db format.  You can waste a lot of time debugging this.  I know this from experience.  More than once in fact. :)\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:25:55", "user": 789801, "id": 1169394}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169395", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Espen Antonsen** - 2011-04-20 08:39:45 UTC\n\nI have been using this patch for so long I forgot I had it.

Then it will build a named route url generation helper from the first permutation, check if the view responds to it and if so, return the method name. If not, it will try the next permutation and so on.\n\nThe first matching permutation will be cached with a cache key that is cheaper to calculate than the whole named route helper method name. I'd expect that this implementation of `build_named_route_call` therefor is also slightly faster than the current one which doesn't use any caching.\n\nSay we have:\n\n```\nclass Site < ActiveRecord::Base; end\nclass Section < ActiveRecord::Base; end\nclass Blog < Section; end\nclass Content < ActiveRecord::Base; end\nclass Post < Content; end\n```\n\nThen passing `[site, blog, post]` will try the following permutations:\n\n```\nsite_blog_post_url\nsite_blog_content_url\nsite_section_post_url\nsite_section_content_url\n```\n\nWe're already using something like this, so this code has been extracted from a working code base.\n\nCaching needs to be improved though. Currently we're just populating a mattr_accessor Hash on the NamedRouteCall class. This cache never gets invalidated but probably should be invalidated in development mode. I'm not sure what the best way is to accomplish this. Maybe named route helper methods should be cached on the actual route set which will be thrown away and rebuilt?\n\nAlso, the patch above applies to current 3-0-stable. I'm unclear about which branch to base this on.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:26:07", "user": 789801, "id": 1169407}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169408", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Joe Hannon** - 2010-12-22 08:12:47 UTC\n\nRails' inability to automatically route my link_to and form_for in STI subclasses to the superclass is a constant source of frustration to me. +1 for fixing this bug.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:26:09", "user": 789801, "id": 1169408}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/5890683", "text": "Why was this issue closed?

I have an issue where querying an association proxy or the parent class of that association does not include the types of the child classes in the query.  The cause appears to be that Rails internal loading engine does not properly load child models of models using Single Table Inheritance.\n\nI resolved this temporarily by explicitly loading all of the classes in the env.rb file.  So now when I call app.breadcrumbs it generates a select statement with a where clause: \"WHERE type='Breadcrumb' OR type='Mark' OR type='Measure'\".\n\nI would be happy to dig through the Rails internals and provide a patch if someone can at least point me where to dig.

Instead of changing the select query from 'id' to '*', I believe the correct fix is to not instantiate the ActiveRecord object for calls to `#exists?`. In the ticket that created this bug, [#2543](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2543), Peter Marklund proposed adding a `:instantiate = false` option to find_every that would tell find_by_sql to not instantiate the records.\n\nI have attached a patch with a test which demonstrates this bug by attempting to access a database attribute in an after_initialize. As a solution, I've implemented Peter Marklund's idea for a skip instantiation option. In addition to resolving this issue, this patch is beneficial because it improves the performance of calls to `#exists?`. As Koz stated in the previous ticket, this saves AR from firing the relevant callbacks for the model.\n\nAny feedback is welcome.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:26:48", "user": 789801, "id": 1169446}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169447", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Marek Kowalski** - 2009-10-24 11:40:32 UTC\n\n-1.

So for what purpose do you use the after_find filter ?\n\nBest,\nMarek\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:26:50", "user": 789801, "id": 1169450}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169451", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rob Olson** - 2009-10-26 03:26:57 UTC\n\nMarek, thank you for sharing how you have employed after_find in your application. I do not know all of the details of your application but I typically handle that situation differently.\n\nOne common way I ensure that the object I am finding belongs to the scope of interest of the current user is to do the find on an association proxy. Koz covered this in a [blog post on therailsway.com](http://www.therailsway.com/2007/3/26/association-proxies-are-your-friend).\n\nIn that case the find will return `nil` which then tells me that the record does not exist. With this technique I can accomplish the same thing in 1 sql query that you are doing with 2.\n\nTo be honest I have not found a good use for the after_find filter yet. However, since I did not know that it was available until recently, I would not have thought to use it before.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:26:50", "user": 789801, "id": 1169451}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169452", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Marek Kowalski** - 2009-10-26 10:09:49 UTC\n\nRob, of course you are right, this is sensible  approach. But you also have to take into consideration that some lame developer could forget about accessing the object through the association, just like: Model.find(params[:id]). This would be a major security breach, but after_find filter comes to the rescue.

Suppose we have classic Post and Comment models (post has many comments, comment belongs to post). There are a few ways to create comment to given post. For example:\n\nComment.create(:post => @post)\nComment.create(:post_id => @post.id)\n\nI made a mistake and mixed those two:\n\nComment.create(:post_id => @post)\n\nIn this case it always create Comment with post_id = 1 regardless of given Post object.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3206\nCreated by **Emin Hasanov** - 2010-12-28 03:36:10 UTC\n\nAs of 2.3.4 rails now raises an exception when habtm table contains a primary key (see #2086).\n\nHowever, on Postgresql, when used with Slony Replication (which is a most popular replication tool), you have to have primary key in order to replicate the table. While you can make a composite key on habtm table, one of the options is to add a synthetic primary key to the table, which was a standard approach with Slony for quite some time now. This is what I had in my setup - multiple replications set up on all of my applications with synthetic keys for all habtm tables.\n\nAfter upgrading to 2.3.4, they have all failed and I had to manually edit has_and_belongs_to_many_association.rb to comment out lines 42-45 to disable the check.\n\nNow, while it is possible for me to alter all my database schemes and redo the replication, it seems to me that for a minor upgrade from 2.3.3 to 2.3.4, this is not the right way. May be it is more appropriate to set up some sort of configuration key that will allow to disable the check for those who really need now and announce that it will not work anymore from version 3.0?\n\nthis is the code that I had commented out\n\nif has_primary_key?\n  raise ActiveRecord::ConfigurationError,\n  \"Primary key is not allowed in a has_and_belongs_to_many join table (#{@reflection.options[:join_table]}).\"\nend\n", "labels": [], "number": 635, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:54", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:53", "id": 904266, "title": "Problem with 2.3.4, habtm and Slony Replication on Postgresql, related to #2086", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/635", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:27:37", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169482", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **pseudonym_ima** - 2009-10-18 01:58:31 UTC\n\nhttp://rubyforge.org/projects/slubydoo/\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:27:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169482}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169483", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rizwan Reza** - 2010-02-12 12:46:18 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/13645)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:27:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169483}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169484", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-09 20:46:45 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:27:39", "user": 789801, "id": 1169484}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

That string will be saved as though it represented a binary number, instead. It is not possible to determine whether such a string represents a binary or hexadecimal number by scanning its contents. Ruby itself imposes prefix tags to make this distinction: e.g. 0b1010 vs. 0x1010. No ActiveRecord DB driver should pretend to infer the base of an untagged string of ones and zeros.\n\nThe solution must either:\n- avoid using bitstring column types altogether (not preferred)\n- support either binary or hexadecimal, make no warranty for the other, and fix the driver code\n- reject untagged strings and fix the driver code\n", "labels": [], "number": 639, "updated_at": "2011-05-25 08:37:45", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:55", "id": 904274, "title": "Postgres data corruption for hexadecimal strings composed of zeros and ones destined for bitstring columns", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/639", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:28:28", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169517", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Bruce Burdick** - 2009-09-26 23:10:21 UTC\n\nCredit goes to Kurt Stephens for identifying this bug.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:28:29", "user": 789801, "id": 1169517}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169518", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rizwan Reza** - 2010-02-12 12:46:19 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/13645)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:28:29", "user": 789801, "id": 1169518}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169519", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-02 16:55:13 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

Problematic application code will manifest itself with a database error exception, rather than putting incorrect data into column.\n\n## \n\nAlex\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:28:30", "user": 789801, "id": 1169520}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169521", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Bruce Burdick** - 2011-03-29 18:35:20 UTC\n\n+1 Alex!\n\nI'm amazed that no one from Rails core has thought that this is important for ~18 months.

{"reactions": {"+1": [3765168, 41740]}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3486\nCreated by **Jordan Brough** - 2011-04-22 05:48:03 UTC\n\nThis is a patch to enable ActiveRecord to identify db-generated errors for unique constraint violations.  For example, it makes the following work _without_ declaring a validates_uniqueness_of:\n\n```\ncreate_table \"users\" do |t|\n  t.string   \"email\",   :null => false\nend\nadd_index \"users\", [\"email\"], :unique => true\n```\n\n```\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\nend\n```\n\n```\nUser.create!(:email => 'asdf@asdf.com')\nu = User.create(:email => 'asdf@asdf.com')\nu.errors[:email]\n=> \"has already been taken\"\n```\n\nThe benefits are speed, ease of use, and completeness --\n## Speed\n\nWith this approach you don't need to do a db lookup to check for uniqueness when saving (which can sometimes be quite slow when the index is missed -- https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2503-validates_uniqueness_of-is-horribly-inefficient-in-mysql ).  If you really care about validating uniqueness you're going to have to use database constraints anyway so the database will validate uniqueness no matter what and this approach removes an extra query.  Checking the index twice isn't a problem for the DB (it's cached the 2nd time around), but saving a DB round-trip from the application is a big win.\n## Ease of use\n\nGiven that you have to have db constraints for true uniqueness anyway, this approach will let everything just happen automatically once the db constraints are in place.  You can still use validates_uniqueness_of if you want to.\n## Completeness\n\nvalidates_uniqueness_of has always been a bit of a hack -- it can't handle race conditions properly and results in exceptions that must be handled using somewhat redundant error handling logic.  (See \"Concurrency and integrity\" section in http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Validations/ClassMethods.html)\n\nSome things to consider with this approach are:\n1. u.valid? returns true before `save` is called since the save must be attempted for the error to be caught.  However, you can still use validates_uniqueness_of in combination with this approach to keep `valid?` working (as far as it can work).\n2. In order to extract the field names of the unique constraint that was violated I am doing a DB lookup after the `save` fails (to query the DB indexes).  If this is a 'bad thing' we could also investigate pre-caching the indexes so that the DB lookup isn't necessary.\n3. It could be (I have no data on this) that applications with high levels of unique-conflicts might see a performance hit by using this approach instead of validates_uniqueness_of, depending on how the DB handles rolling back from a failed update/insert.  However, this patch improves the common case and and anyone with a high percentage of rollbacks that does see a performance hit can just add the validates_uniquenes_of constraint.\n\nI've implemented handling for mysql (tested on 5.0 & 5.1), sqlite (tested on 3.6.11) & postgres (tested on 8.3.6) with graceful failover if the db error message can't be parsed or for other dbs that don't handlers written for them. (Outputs a generic error message in that case).\n\nI added handling for composite unique indexes as follows:\n\n```\n# composite unique index on [:field1, :field2, :field3]\nu1 = User.create!(:field1 => 'a', :field2 => 'a', :field3 => 'a')\nu2 = User.create(:field1 => 'a', :field2 => 'a', :field3 => 'a')\nu2.errors[:field1]\n=> [\"has already been taken for field2/field3\"]\n```\n\nPatches attached for master and 2-3-stable including tests.  Thoughts?\n\nNOTE:  The 2-3-stable patch depends on applying the following patches from ticket #2419 (which seems like a good idea to me anyway, given that they apply cleanly).

Super excited to see this patch! It would be nice to populate the AR error messages for save! before raising the exception as well, to be consistent with standard validation functionality. Those who make heavy use of save!/rescue RecordInvalid will miss out.\n\nSince this looks wrapped up, I pulled some changes from my [similar 2.3 gem](http://github.com/blythedunham/rails_devs_for_data_integrity), and logged a separate ticket #3614 to resolve this and some of the other inconsistencies mentioned above. It add hooks to `validates_uniqueness_of` so developers can explicitly declare intent to use this alternative, provide custom error messages, and raises RecordInvalid instead of RecordNotUnique errors consistent with AR validation functionality.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:29:36", "user": 789801, "id": 1169572}, {"reactions": {"+1": [3765168, 41740]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169573", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jordan Brough** - 2010-01-16 03:51:15 UTC\n\nAttaching updated patches rebased against latest master + 2-3-stable.

(thanks to blythe for pointing that out!).\n\nI don't agree with trying to squeeze `validates_uniqueness_of` into use here.  The model can't configure or enable/disable the DB constraint and I think it's confusing to pretend that it does.  The exception will happen regardless of model settings so Rails ought to just handle it automatically as gracefully as possible.

Whether to improve that is probably a good item for a separate ticket.  This ticket is about using the db (for the reasons above) to enforce uniqueness while making it fit into the standard AR model as nicely as possible.  Figuring out which columns caused the unique constraint violation is something that db's _can't_ provide via error numbers.  I see your point about the parsing failing in non-english, but this patch was designed to fail gracefully in that case to a generic uniqueness message while still bringing normal AR error handling.  Patches that build on this one to add multi-language support seem like a great idea to me.\n\nChristos - the issue you brings up spans both the earlier commit I mentioned as well as mine.  Sounds like a great add-on patch (to address it on both levels) after we get this committed.  In any case, this patch won't make the situation any worse for NDB.

If you rescue that and do record.reload, it will load the record the first process saved, but without clearing the new_record flag. So if you try to save that record in the process that reloaded, it does an insert and throws another ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique. The behavior is inconsistent, it should either not allow you to call reload on a new_record, or it should clear the new_record flag if the reload succeeded. The documentation for new_record? says that it returns false if a record for the object doesn't exist yet, which maybe indicates the fix should be to clear the new_record flag.\n", "labels": [], "number": 646, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:56", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:56", "id": 904285, "title": "Reloading a new record results in an inconsistent state", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/646", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:29:49", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169588", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Matt Jones** - 2009-11-22 07:48:10 UTC\n\nWhy on earth are you trying to pick an ID for the record before it's saved?

In fact that solution was stated in my original ticket. The reason I patched it the way I did was because my particular use case needed me to fetch the record I thought was new, but wasn't, from the database. So if I didn't do it that way, I'd have to do something like record.replace(Model.find(record.id)).\n\nWhether or not use you a non-auto-increment PK is another argument, but that case is clearly supported.

Take the example of Posts & Comments.  I want a counter cache for comments, but I don't want to include ones that are deleted.  This should also take into account updates as well as creates & deletes.\n\nHere's an example of the syntax:\n\n  belongs_to :post, :counter_cache => {:condition => lambda {|c| !c.deleted } }\n\nThis only increments or decrements the counter if the lambda returns true (and the lambda has self passed in).\n\nI've added support for this in the following patch.

That way, I only ever soft delete something (changing the status rather than actually deleting the row).  But, if the status is deleted, the user likely doesn't see the object listed anymore, so the counts are off.  I also always have to write multiple callbacks as well - since checking a column for changes doesn't work on create (and there's no way to tell if an object is new in after_save), I have to make two callbacks, one for after_update and one for after_create - and they usually both have very similar logic.

Additionally, the \":deleted ? true : false\" expression would be evaluated too early (at class compilation time, and not at execution time).  The only real way around this is a lambda.  I could simplify the code to:\n\nbelongs_to :post, :counter_cache => lambda {|c| !c.deleted }\n\nBut then, there's no way for the existing option of having a custom column name to be passed in W\n\nWhich is what the current options allow:\n\nbelongs_to :post, :counter_cache => :users_postz\n\nSo the only way to allow both of these existing options is to provide a hash as the argument, in which case the logic can handle both options (and future options as well).\n\nbelongs_to :post, :counter_cache => {:condition => lambda {|c| !c.deleted }, :cache_column => :user_postz}\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:04", "user": 789801, "id": 1169615}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169616", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jim Meyer** - 2010-08-23 23:07:50 UTC\n\nDefinite +1 for the functionality. The patch as offered is a good start, but will break some existing functionality. For example, it's perhaps not well known that this is a valid counter cache declaration:\n\n``` ruby\nclass Comment\n  belongs_to :post, :counter_cache => 'visible_comments_count'\nend\n```\n\nThis works because ActiveRecord::Reflection::AssociationReflection#counter_cache_column does this:\n\n``` ruby\n  def counter_cache_column\n    if options[:counter_cache] == true\n      \"#{active_record.name.demodulize.underscore.pluralize}_count\"\n    elsif options[:counter_cache]\n      options[:counter_cache]\n    end\n  end\n```\n\n... so slinging a Hash as :counter_cache won't work. Perhaps better to pass it as :counter_cache_conditions.\n\nThe other breakage has to do with ActiveRecord::Base.reset_counters, which currently expects to operate entirely inside the database. If the counter cache's conditions aren't able to be reduced to SQL, reset_counters must load all counted objects and consider them in Rails-space, which chews up memory and is not likely to perform well for large numbers of counted objects.\n\nI'm working on a fix as a plugin inside an app which needs this; if I manage it well, I'll gemify it and share.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:05", "user": 789801, "id": 1169616}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169617", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-09 21:11:19 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:05", "user": 789801, "id": 1169617}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169618", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeff Kreeftmeijer** - 2010-10-10 12:03:24 UTC\n\nUsing the \"patch\" tag instead of prefixing the ticket title with \"[PATCH]\" to make sure patched tickets end up in the [open patches bin](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/bins/5805). :)\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:06", "user": 789801, "id": 1169618}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169619", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Szymon Nowak** - 2011-04-27 08:37:13 UTC\n\nWouldn't actually moving `counter_cache` declaration from `belongs_to` to `has_many` solve this problem?\n\n``` ruby\nclass Post\n  has_many :likes, :class_name => \"Vote\", :conditions => { :flag => true }, :counter_cache => true\n  has_many :dislikes, :class_name => \"Vote\", :conditions => { :flag => false }, :counter_cache => \"some_fancy_column_name\"\nend\n\nclass Vote\n  belongs_to :post\nend\n\nPost.first.likes.size # could use proper counter cache\n```\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:06", "user": 789801, "id": 1169619}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169620", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **swindsor** - 2011-04-27 16:18:23 UTC\n\nThat might be another solution - it's less backwards compatible, but might be a good direction.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3565\nCreated by **Stephen Celis** - 2011-02-22 08:32:35 UTC\n\nThe convenience methods @.first@ and @.last@ on @ActiveRecord::Base@ have had me itching to pass in an integer limit as you can with @Array#first@ and @#last@. E.g.,\n\n``` ruby\narray = [1, 2, \"buckle\", :my, Shoe]\narray.first    # => 1\narray.first(2) # => [1, 2]\narray.first(1) # => [1]\narray.last(2)  # => [:my, Shoe]\n```\n\nAttached is a patch that adds this functionality.\n\n``` ruby\nPerson.first    # => #<Person id: 1>\nPerson.first(2) # => [#<Person id: 1>, #<Person id: 2>]\nPerson.first(1) # => [#<Person id: 1>]\nPerson.last(2)  # => [#<Person id: 49>, #<Person id: 50>]\n```\n\nConsiderations:\n\nActiveRecord::Base subclasses are not kinds of Array, but named scopes and association proxies come closer. Consider the following:\n\n``` ruby\n>> Person.scoped({}).first    # SELECT * FROM `people` LIMIT 1\n=> #<Person>\n>> Person.scoped({}).first(2) # SELECT * FROM `people`\n=> [#<Person>, #<Person>]\n```\n\nThe first gets special treatment. The second does not. In order to make the second consistent, it only makes sense to add the behavior to @ActiveRecord::Base@ as well. (Named scope functionality requires additions to this patch, but I'd prefer a consensus before making any more changes.)\n\nAdditionally, it made the most sense to add logic through to @ActiveRecord.find_initial@, rather than merely to the convenience, surface methods, but this obviously could cause problems for those who have been blindly passing options hashes to @find(:first)@ and @:last@ that include a @:limit@. I'm open to the idea of a less-invasive approach that merely adds the functionality to the convenience methods, but this seemed less desirable and messier.\n\nIf this is of interest to others, it could also be added to @ActiveResource::Base@.\n", "labels": [], "number": 649, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:57", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:56", "id": 904289, "title": "Add limit functionality to find first and last", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/649", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:41", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169634", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-11 11:09:20 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:41", "user": 789801, "id": 1169634}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169635", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Anil Wadghule** - 2010-10-12 08:10:32 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:42", "user": 789801, "id": 1169635}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169636", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aditya Sanghi** - 2010-10-12 09:10:45 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:43", "user": 789801, "id": 1169636}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169637", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aditya Sanghi** - 2010-10-12 09:13:51 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:30:44", "user": 789801, "id": 1169637}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169638", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aditya Sanghi** - 2010-10-13 17:13:26 UTC\n\n@Stephen, this functionality is now already in place in Rails 3.0.0.

Every default deployment of rails sends headers to make responses non-cacheable which is a security-wise decision. But the problem is, as soon as you call \"redirect_to\" it does no longer generate these default headers BUT it still sends the \"Set-Cookie\" header if you accessed the session before (which you usually do if you create session-based authenticators and redirect back to a previous page). But http responses without \"Cache-Control\" headers are allowed to be cached by either reverse proxies or client caches - and this includes the \"Set-Cookie\" header!\n\nWhat follows is a whole cascade of other problems:\n- \"Location\" headers become cachable (we loose control over if a request is to be redirected or not because the cache decides)\n- \"Set-Cookie\" headers become cacheable which opens Rails to session hijacking on redirects\n- ...\n\nCounter measures:\n- Rails should not send a \"Set-Cookie\" handler if I only did a read access to the session[] hash (it won't change, why send again?)\n- Rails should not skip default headers on redirects\n- Rails should handle bad combinations of Set-Cookie and Cache-Control gracefully (except the user EXPLICITLY wants to make Set-Cookie cachable) and especially never generate those bad combinations\n- Rails should never skip sending default Cache-Control headers if Set-Cookie is to be send (which actually happens in current versions when you use redirect_to)\n\nQuickfix:\n\nOverwrite `redirect_to_full_url` in your `ApplicationController` like so:\n\n``` ruby\nclass ApplicationController < ActionController::Base\n\n  private\n\n  def redirect_to_full_url(url, status)\n    headers[\"Cache-Control\"] = \"private, no-cache, max-age=0, must-revalidate\"\n    super url, status\n  end\nend\n```\n", "labels": [], "number": 651, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:57", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:57", "id": 904292, "title": "redirect_to skips generation of headers (security problem)", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/651", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:07", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169656", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rohit Arondekar** - 2010-10-08 02:18:18 UTC\n\nMarking ticket as stale.

See http://code.google.com/p/doctype/wiki/ArticleHttpCaching.\n\nHowever, I wonder why it sends a \"no-cache\" value - it never did that in my application: This seems to be a new behaviour since 2.3.8 (which I am currently using).\n\nEssentially, what the link says is that sending Set-Cookie (or Location) with a missing Cache-Control may make public caches store these headers for later responses from the cache. Rails should have counter-measures to prevent such cases if the user/programmer/developer does not implicitly create such situations.\n\nAlthough the document also says that special response codes like 302 would never be cached, I found that some caches (eg mod_cache in Apache) cache that.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:12", "user": 789801, "id": 1169661}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169662", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Kai Krakow** - 2010-10-15 10:21:16 UTC\n\nTo reproduce, create a test application:\n\n```\n  $ rails test\n  $ ruby script/generate controller Test index redirect\n  $ rm public/index.html\n  $ vim app/controllers/test_controller.rb\n```\n\nChange TestController#redirect to \"redirect_to '/test/index'\"\n\n```\n  $ ruby script/server\n```\n\nNow on another console run\n\n```\n  $ curl -I \"http://localhost:3000/test/index\"\n  HTTP/1.1 200 OK\n  [...]\n  Cache-Control: private, max-age=0, must-revalidate\n```\n\nNow compare the redirect action:\n\n```\n  $ curl -I \"http://localhost:3000/test/redirect\"\n  HTTP/1.1 302 Moved Temporarily\n  [...]\n  Location: http://localhost:3000/test/index\n  Cache-Control: no-cache\n```\n\nIt's no longer sending \"Cache-Control: private\".

One of the use cases for redirecting is to redirect to a login page when a protected page (e.g. admin page) is accessed. If we used private then this would allow the browser to cache the response. The default max-age of zero would mean that in effect it would work but the explicit no-cache seems the right response and is what the link recommends.\n\nIn terms of the anti-pattern you specify that relates to a missing expires header with a set-cookie header being cached with HTTP/1.0 proxies. In this case we are sending a 302 response which shouldn't be cached unless explicitly specified using cc:public or an expires header set in the future.\n\nAs the comment points out at the bottom of the article, the chances of running into a HTTP/1.0 proxy that doesn't respond to cache-control headers is virtually zero anyway.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:14", "user": 789801, "id": 1169665}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169666", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-19 07:33:03 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:15", "user": 789801, "id": 1169666}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169667", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeff Kreeftmeijer** - 2010-11-08 08:52:03 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:15", "user": 789801, "id": 1169667}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

The trick is that the scopes are stored in an inheritable attribute - not a big deal for 3.0, since the methods are defined in-place without an actual reference to the array (see around line 89 in named_scopes.rb on master). On 2.3.x, the method that's defined only references the array:\n\n``` ruby\ndefine_method name do |*args|\n  scopes[name].call(self, *args)\nend\n```\n\nThus, in Admin::User above, you end up with a `second_order` method inherited from the parent, but scopes[:second_order] returns nil since the subclass has an empty hash which was inherited from the parent at definition time.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:47", "user": 789801, "id": 1169692}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169693", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Neeraj Singh** - 2010-06-25 21:10:34 UTC\n\nI can confirm that it is indeed and error with 2-3-stable.

The problem is that I can't extend an String in a way that makes sense. I first tried ErrorMessage to extend String, but it didn't work as I was expecting... The mixed object was the only thing I could think of for not breaking API compatibility.\n\nFor instance, if self.errors[:attribute] always return a string, how errors.full_messages would know if it has to include a prefix or not? If it returns an ErrorMessage object, it would break the API and possible a lot of plugins. The solution I proposed, although not ideal, is less invasive to current API.\n\nThe correct way to do this in my opinion is to change the API so that errors[:attribute] would return an ErrorMessage object instead of a String, but that would be a big change.

When I tested subclassing String, I probably missed the message parameter in initialize.\n\nBut it is still a hack in the sense that unexpected things can happen (it would also happen with the current patch). For instance:\n\n  error = ErrorMessage.new('test', true)\n  error.sub(/t/,'a').full_message? # returns nil, although error.sub(/t/,'a').class == ErrorMessage\n\nThat is just an example for sub, but other methods are affected too.\n\nBut I think that is OK. At least it is better than the current patch. I'll update the patch to subclass String instead of mixed objects and will update this ticket than. Probably tonight when I have some time...

For example, why are you checking inside ErrorMessage if it's receiving another ErrorMessage? What is the use case? Why not use duck typing?\n\nAlso, I noticed that you changed all validators. Would be better if we encapsulate the logic in one method in the EachValidator and DRY the +record.errors.add+ logic.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:58", "user": 789801, "id": 1169706}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169707", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rodrigo Rosenfeld Rosas** - 2010-02-25 12:00:14 UTC\n\nI have dryied the code. The part I have changed in all validators were necessary because it was not modular, so I couldn't change just one place. See an example:\n\n``` ruby\n# record.errors.add(attr_name, :not_a_number, :value => raw_value, :default => options[:message])\n  record.errors.add(attr_name, :not_a_number, :value => raw_value, :default => message)\n\n# message is a new method from Validator:\ndef message\n  return nil unless options[:full_message] || options[:message]\n  @message ||= Errors::ErrorMessage.new(options)\nend\n```\n\nHow could I not change every validator once they extract the :message value from options?\n\nSupporting full_messages is not the only goal of this patch. Now plugins are able to do more interesting things with the params passed to validations.\n\nFor instance:\n\n``` ruby\n  # show this specific message in blue if this validation fails\n  validates_presence_of :field, :show_error => :blue\n```\n\nAll options would be available through error.message[:field].first.options, and it is also possible to know if a symbol was passed to the message evaluating what os passed for :full_message or :message with error.message[:field].first.message.\n\nHaving said that, duck typing in ErrorMessage#initialize would loose the options and original message if another ErrorMessage is passed to ErrorMessage#new. The above extract of the patch wouldn't be necessary, but it is there just for performance concerns:\n\n``` ruby\n  predicate = ErrorMessage.new(predicate) unless predicate.is_a? ErrorMessage\n  # this could be just:\n  predicate = ErrorMessage.new(predicate)\n```\n\nRegarding the documentation, it would be like the text in my first comment. I just don't know if I should add that explanation to every single validation...\n\nThe test case would be something like (I didn't test the code below):\n\n``` ruby\n  test \"Validation should accept an :full_message option\" do\n    fm = 'You should specify your full name.'\n    # some setup code (validates_presence_of :name, :full_message => fm)\n    assert_equals fm, errors.full_messages[:name]\n  end\n  # one more test for passing a symbol instead of a string to :full_message\n```\n\nDon't hesitate in asking me further doubts.\n\nP.S: one more thing: with this change of subclassing String, now it is possible to use Array(messages) as in the original code instead of Array.wrap(messages). I just forgot to change this back on my patch, but I'll do it on next patch.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:31:59", "user": 789801, "id": 1169707}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169708", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jos√© Valim** - 2010-02-25 12:15:57 UTC\n\nYes, you need to change all validators but if you are going to do that, it's better that they now all call the same method. However, validators should not know about ErrorMessage, they should simple call record.errors.add which will know what to do.\n\nAlso, I don't see the point in having options inside ErrorMessage.

How much dryier can this be? All validators just call the message method from Validator (from which them all inherit from). That method extract the message from the options. What would suggest instead of this? How could this be simpler than that?\n\nAnd I don't get what are the advantages for not storing all validation options? Why should this go in a separate patch?\n\nI'm not hiding the real intent, but I do intend multiple features:\n- supporting full_messages\n- store all validation options\n\nIf I have some way to know what options were passed to some validation, I could have done a plugin without monkey patches for supporting full_messages, for instance... This change will be specially useful for I18n plugins because they will be able to do lazy evaluation (actually re-evaluation) for instance if they decide to override full_messages_for, for instance.\n\nThe patch for supporting just the :full_message option would not be that different from what it is now.

The final review effort will actually be higher... Splitting it in two patches would require me a lot of effort and I would just want to understand why it does compensate... I mean, what are the disadvantages of storing the options passed to the validators alongside with the message?\n\nI can't understand why you are insisting that validators should not know about ErrorMessage... There is no mention to ErrorMessage in any of the validators... The only difference is that instead of passing options[:message] to errors.add, they would pass the result of the method 'message' from their parent Validator. If they wish to pass options[:message] instead, it will still work as before, but will not support the full_message parameter...

I will copy them for convenience:\n\nYour patch is almost there, the only change I would do is to change generate_message to receive a key as argument:\n\n```\ngenerate_message(attributes, message, options, type)\n```\n\nThis way you can skip checking for :full_message inside generate_message and do everything based on the type given.\n\nAnother thing is that, once you write tests, you will see your patch is broken because generate_message is acting destructively in the hash. So the first time it is called, it will remove :full_message and :message from the options hash, so the second call won't work (because it won't have any)!

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/3927\nCreated by **tadman** - 2011-01-27 05:34:14 UTC\n\nIn Rails 3.0.0-pre, when caching JavaScript and CSS assets, a mysterious error is generated on systems with a separate partition for temporary files.\n\nActionView::Helpers.write_asset_file_contents makes use of File.atomic_write with no tmp_dir parameter specified. This defaults to Dir.tmpdir accordingly, however, it appears that if this directory is on a different volume than the Rails application then an error will result when apparently trying to create a hard-link to move the cached asset file:\n\n```\nActionView::Template::Error (Invalid cross-device link - /tmp//_main.css20100210-24481-ilznwv-0 or public/stylesheets/_main.css)\n```\n\nThis was generated from a simple asset-caching request:\n\n```\nstylesheet_link_tag('reset', 'master', 'forms', :cache => '_main')\n```\n\nThis would only seem to be an issue on systems where Dir.tmpname returns a path on a different volume than where Rails.root is situated. On some Linux installations /tmp is given its own partition.\n\nA simple patch is to use the default Rails tmp/ directory by modifying the call in write_asset_file_contents to be:\n\n```\nmodule ActionView\n  module Helpers\n    def write_asset_file_contents(joined_asset_path, asset_paths)\n\n      FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.dirname(joined_asset_path))\n      File.atomic_write(joined_asset_path, File.join(Rails.root, 'tmp')) { |cache| cache.write(join_asset_file_contents(asset_paths)) }\n\n      # Set mtime to the latest of the combined files to allow for\n      # consistent ETag without a shared filesystem.\n      mt = asset_paths.map { |p| File.mtime(asset_file_path(p)) }.max\n      File.utime(mt, mt, joined_asset_path)\n    end\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIt stands to reason that the environment could be tweaked so that TMPDIR is assigned accordingly somewhere during the initialization, but that may alter behavior on a much larger scale.\n\nThe previous implementation in Rails 2.3.5 does not use atomic_write and does not suffer from this problem:\n\n```\nFile.open(joined_asset_path, \"w+\") { |cache| cache.write(join_asset_file_contents(asset_paths)) }\n```\n\nThis has the unfortunate effect of presumably failing if the Rails application does not have its own tmp/ directory.\n", "labels": [], "number": 657, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:58", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:58", "id": 904304, "title": "Rails 3.0.0-pre - stylesheet_link_tag, javascript_include_tag cache fails when using File.atomic_write: Invalid cross-device link", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/657", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:05", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169796", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **renchap** - 2010-03-08 13:03:32 UTC\n\nSame problem here, /tmp is on a different partition and I get the error.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:06", "user": 789801, "id": 1169796}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169797", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Scott Marshall** - 2010-03-22 18:26:44 UTC\n\nI can confirm that atomic_write is indeed the culprit.\n\nwrite_asset_file_contents calls it without a tmp path argument so it defaults to the system tmp dir which normally is /tmp.\n\nBeing able to configure an alternate tmp dir for atomic writes would solve the problem.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:06", "user": 789801, "id": 1169797}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169799", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-08-30 03:10:31 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/27625)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169799}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169800", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-10-15 22:01:44 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/31647)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169800}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169801", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-19 07:34:03 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169801}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169802", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2010-11-15 21:04:50 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/34349)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1169802}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169803", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-12 21:58:20 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/42275)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:39", "user": 789801, "id": 1169803}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169804", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-27 03:15:38 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/43692)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:33:39", "user": 789801, "id": 1169804}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

Most of our customers/field engineers have no ruby/rails background. When the product is installed, code resides in a directory with read permissions and log/config files reside in a directory with read/write permission. The config directory contain ONLY the files that an administrator can change, i.e. `database.yml` and `app_config.yml`. This done in order to avoid any mishaps in production systems. \n\nThis is a common pattern for a corporate deployment.

The suggested shebang doesn't work.\n2) Maybe re-introduce script/runner?\n", "labels": [], "number": 665, "updated_at": "2017-06-28 19:24:33", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:59", "id": 904319, "title": "\"rails runner\" can't be used in shebang lines", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/665", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:34:45", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169848", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **trevor** - 2010-03-23 00:28:16 UTC\n\n+1\n\nthis is a big issue for me as well\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:34:45", "user": 789801, "id": 1169848}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169849", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rohit Arondekar** - 2010-06-22 05:00:10 UTC\n\nYehuda, will you be working on this?

But it leads to duplication i.e there is a rails runner command and the same code in script/runner. We could maybe deprecate <code>rails runner</code> and in the next to next release remove it altogether.\n\n2] Running the <code>rails runner</code> command from within <code>script/runner</code> using shell script\n\nI don't know if I can write a general script that will work in bash, sh and other scripting environments. So I immediately stopped trying in this direction.\n\n3] Running the <code>rails runner</code> command from within <code>script/runner</code> using Ruby\n\nThis looks like the most promising way and seems to work perfectly fine.

I'm unhappy with a few areas that perhaps you can suggest alternatives:\n1. How do we cleanly get the concurrency_model value from the Rails::Application instance down to the ConnectionPool?  My defined? code is definitely a hack.\n2. I had to pull in EventMachine into the Gemfile in order to test the Fibers actually executing.  The wait queue uses EM to pause while waiting for a connection and I'm not sure we want to introduce that dependency into ActiveRecord, even if it's pulled in dynamically.\n3. There's no real way to implement remove_stale_cached_threads! since we can't get a list of Fibers in the system.  I hacked it in em_postgresql by registering the application's FiberPool manually.

The patch i've added adds the failing test. The error received is \"1 error(s) on assignment of multiparameter attributes\". You will NOT get an error if the chosen minute is between 0-12. time select needs a default date, without the date, the Hour, Minute, Second become Year, Month, Day. So the Hour shifts to year, minute shifts to month (so if you have it bigger than 12 you get an error and if its less than 12 you don't get an error), seconds shifts to day (if you seconds greater than 30/31 you will also see an error).\n\nSimply put, i think the documentation and the time_select function needs to be modified to not accept :ignore_date => true as an option.\n\nPlease see test \"test_time_select_without_date_hidden_fields\" in actionpack/test/template/date_helper_test.rb which tests for creation of fields without the date bits. \n\nOnce we are convinced about this.

In other words, these will be equivalent:\n\n```\nextract_callstack_for_multiparameter_attributes('datetime(1i)' => '1') # => {\"sometime\"=>[1]}\nextract_callstack_for_multiparameter_attributes('datetime(1i)' => '', 'datetime(2i)' => '1') # => {\"sometime\"=>[nil, 1]}\n# missing field\nextract_callstack_for_multiparameter_attributes('datetime(2i)' => '1') # => {\"sometime\"=>[1]}\n```\n\nFor a Date attribute, the nil are preserved and replaced with default values; for a Time attribute that doesn't happen, leading to POLA failures.\nThis looks silly to me: we have a position index, we should use it to either provide default values for missing parts (if sensible) or raise an exception if we still can't make sense of the input. What we should never, ever do is let malformed input silently cause unintended changes.\n\nIN FACT, now that I think of it, I think this can be exploited by an attacker to change the date part of a Datetime, as long as she is authorized to change the time part of it:\n\n```\nt = TimeTest.new(:sometime => DateTime.now - 1.month)\n => #<TimeTest id: nil, sometime: \"2010-09-13 06:50:55\", created_at: nil, updated_at: nil> \n...\n\n# legitimate access to a form with time_select(:sometime)\n# params = {\"time_test\"=>{\"sometime(1i)\"=>\"2010\", \"sometime(2i)\"=>\"9\", \"sometime(3i)\"=>\"13\", \"sometime(4i)\"=>\"06\", \"sometime(5i)\"=>\"12\"}}\nt.update_attributes(params['time_test']) # => true \nt                                        # => #<TimeTest id: 2, sometime: \"2010-09-13 06:12:00\", created_at: \"2010-10-13 06:49:26\", updated_at: \"2010-09-13 2010-09-13 06:12:00\"> \n\n# maliciously crafted POST\n# params = {\"time_test\"=>{\"sometime(4i)\"=>\"2009\", \"sometime(5i)\"=>\"12\", \"sometime(6i)\"=>\"12\"}}\nt.update_attributes(params['time_test']) # => true \nt                                        # => #<TimeTest id: 2, sometime: \"2009-12-12 00:00:00\", created_at: \"2010-10-13 06:49:26\", updated_at: \"2010-10-13 06:51:06\"> \n```\n\nBecause of this I think this issue should get a higher priority; I will provide a patch within the day.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:35:39", "user": 789801, "id": 1169903}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169904", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Andrea Campi** - 2010-10-13 07:08:45 UTC\n\n(and just after I press update--sorry for following up on myself)\n\nMaybe considering this a security issue is a bit of a stretch, as any web application trusting its input is bound to be broken way worse that this.

{ |v| !v.nil? }\n      send(name + \"=\", nil)\n    else\n    ```\n  - adding a <code>@#to_i@</code> to <code>@find_parameter_position@</code> would let you remove the <code>@#to_i@ / @#to_s@</code> when you fill <code>@set_values@</code>\n\nI left this at the end because I couldn't think of a solution (in fact, it affected the patch I was working on, too), but with your patch it's quite trivial to perform a denial of service attack by making Ruby run out of memory:\n\n``` ruby\nattributes = { \"address(100000000)\" => \"\" } # add enough 0\n```\n\nThat's a non-trivial problem that we would be introducing, and I think it needs to be addressed--if nothing else, by capping the position to 100 or so.\n\nI'm attaching my additional tests (applied on top of your changes), see if they are any use and feel free to change them and integrate them in your final diff.\nI'll be glad to review it and upvote it once the last concerns are addressed.\n\n<em>Edited by [Rohit Arondekar](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/users/89656) for formatting.</em>\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:35:42", "user": 789801, "id": 1169911}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169912", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aditya Sanghi** - 2010-10-15 17:01:27 UTC\n\nAlways humbled and glad that i'm doing more open source now.

This is a sensible default, but there is other code in the adapter that attempts to extract the primary key from the table. I do not know the history behind this, and was trying to clone the :primary_key API for associations.\n- Many active_record tests run with \"use_transactional_fixtures = false\", which results in leftover data during the foreign key tests. This makes adding foreign keys difficult, when the existing data has invalid references.\n- drop_table blows up if the table being dropped has foreign keys pointing to it. One option is to ignore foreign key checks during this (e.g. in MySql use \"SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0; super; SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;\"\n", "labels": [], "number": 668, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:59", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:11:59", "id": 904324, "title": "Add foreign key support to migrations and schema.rb dump", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/668", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:35:58", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169943", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **matthuhiggins** - 2010-04-08 18:27:37 UTC\n\nOops, this patch left out tests for the schema dumper.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:35:58", "user": 789801, "id": 1169943}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169944", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **matthuhiggins** - 2010-04-08 20:52:03 UTC\n\nforeign_keys-2.diff tests that foreign keys are dumped to schema.rb after the tables\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:35:59", "user": 789801, "id": 1169944}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169945", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **2kan** - 2010-11-23 11:48:46 UTC\n\n+1.

I've used STI (single table inheritance), but I don't think it's relevant as I'm pretty sure I could replicate the problem without STI as well.\n\nThe SQL query generated by a call to the through-association (Person.find(7).babydaddies) generates a SQL query which includes a self-join of the table to itself.

It should be executed within the \"destroy\" transaction, however, so that any changes it makes can be rolled back.\n\n``` ruby\nclass Foo < AR::Base\n has_many :children, :dependent => :destroy\n has_many :grandchildren, :through => :children\n\n before_destroy :check\n def check\n  # will always be true since all grandchildren have already been destroyed at this stage\n  return self.grandchildren.still_there.empty?\n end\nend\n\nclass Child < AR::Base\n has_many :grandchildren\n belongs_to :foo\nend\n\nclass Grandchild < AR::Base\n belongs_to :child\n named_scope :still_there, :conditions => ...\nend\n```\n", "labels": [], "number": 670, "updated_at": "2018-02-11 20:12:56", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:00", "id": 904330, "title": "dependent => :destroy deletes children before \"before_destroy\" is executed", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/670", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:37:10", "comments": [{"reactions": {"+1": [180819]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169983", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-04-14 03:22:59 UTC\n\nCould you perhaps create another method that you can call BEFORE calling destroy on the Foo record?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:37:11", "user": 789801, "id": 1169983}, {"reactions": {"+1": [180819]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169984", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Andrew White** - 2010-04-14 07:46:03 UTC\n\nAnother option is to override the destroy method, e.g:\n\n``` ruby\nclass Order < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :items\n\n  def destroy\n    ok_to_destroy? ? super : self\n  end\n\n  private\n    def ok_to_destroy?\n      errors.clear\n      errors.add(:items, \"Can't destroy order as items have been processed\") if items.processed_any?\n      errors.empty?\n    end\n  end\nend\n\nclass Item < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :order\n  named_scope :processed, :conditions => { :processed => true }\nend\n```\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:37:11", "user": 789801, "id": 1169984}, {"reactions": {"+1": [180819]}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1169985", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jens** - 2010-04-15 05:44:12 UTC\n\nThank you for the hints!\n\nCreating another method and manually calling this before destroying children is IMO exactly what :before_destroy should be for.

My issue isn't with whether or not it is internally consistent. The behavior is predictable, once you understand what is happening. My issue is that it introduces a non-obvious (and potentially destructive) gotcha. So, at the very least, something about the developer experience could be improved.\n\nI mean, aside from a brief mention in the docs, nothing about `before_destroy` indicates that it won't run before any and all destructive operations. And nothing about `:dependent` indicates that it is built on `before_destroy`. Sure, you can simply re-order your code, which means putting callbacks before association declarations.

This makes it so other JSON encoding libraries don't have to know or do anything special to encode the object.\n\nIf this were the expected behavior, C extension JSON libraries would be able to take advantage of the #as_json method as an optimization over calling #to_json - which may be doing it's own encoding in Ruby land.\n\nSee: http://gist.github.com/386545\n\nA little backstory for the gist:\nEach ActiveRecord object is having it's #to_json method called, which is falling through ActiveSupport's JSON encoder in pure ruby.\nAn an example in using the Mysql2 gem directly, I'm able to get pure ruby hashes and encode them in C.\n\nThe comparison isn't totally fair, since using ActiveRecord will surely be a little slower than using the db driver directly - but my hope is that you can see the benefits in returning mappable ruby types to the encoder directly.\n", "labels": [], "number": 673, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:01", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:01", "id": 904334, "title": "#as_json should only ever return a Hash, Array, Numeric, String, nil, true or false", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/673", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:37:59", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170026", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-02 16:43:09 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

Although I believe the implementation of this for habtm associations is wrong (I mean unwanted), I have not changed that behavior with this patch.

I wrote a plugin that did something similar a long time ago (http://github.com/TylerRick/has_and_belongs_to_many_with_deferred_save ), but Lawrence's implementation is much better. I haven't actually tried out these patches yet, but at least from reading through them, they look fantastic.\n\n## Question about AutosaveAssociation\n\n> 1) The current behavior, with or without :autosave => true, is that when you add or delete a record to a collection association, the link is immediately saved to the database, if the owner of the association already exists in the database.\n\nThat sounds correct. But AutosaveAssociation also has [mark_for_destruction](http://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/activerecord/lib/active_record/autosave_association.rb#L81):\n\n``` ruby\n  # Destroying one of the associated models members, as part of the parent's\n  # save action, is as simple as marking it for destruction:\n  #\n  #   post.comments.last.mark_for_destruction\n  #   post.comments.last.marked_for_destruction? # => true\n  #   post.comments.length # => 2\n  #\n  # Note that the model is _not_ yet removed from the database:\n  #   id = post.comments.last.id\n  #   Comment.find_by_id(id).nil? # => false\n  #\n  #   post.save\n  #   post.reload.comments.length # => 1\n  #\n  # Now it _is_ removed from the database:\n  #   Comment.find_by_id(id).nil? # => true\n```\n\nCouldn't we simply use that instead of keeping a separate `pending_link_deletions` array? What's the difference?\n\nWhen used with `accepts_nested_attributes_for`, doesn't the :autosave behavior already not do any inserts, deletes, or updates to nested/associated models until you call save on the parent? Can't we use that somehow?\n\n## Different semantics?\n\nIt looks like you're adding on some new behavior (to handle the case where we add a **new, not-already-associated object** to the association collection, or delete a member from that association) to the existing `:autosave => true` option (which I believe only handled the case of auto-saving (updating) changes made to **existing, already-associated associated objects** when you call save before).\n\nMy next question is, should the existing `:autosave` option be extended with this new behavior or should a new option with a different name be used instead?\n1. Is the purpose of this new addition related closely enough to the existing `:autosave` purpose/behavior to warrant them both using the same option?\n2. Would we ever want to enable one behavior but not the other?\n\nThis, IIRC, is the _current_ behavior (and the purpose/primary use case for) `:autosave`:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<th>\n`:autosave => false` (default)\n</th>\n<th>\n`:autosave => true`\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\nModifying **existing** associated objects when you call save)\n</th>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost = Post.first\npost.comments[0].subject # => 'Old'\npost.comments[0].subject = 'New'\npost.save\npost.reload\npost.comments[0].subject # => 'Old'\n\\# Changes were not saved -- at all\n```\n</td>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost = Post.first\npost.comments[0].subject # => 'Old'\npost.comments[0].subject = 'New'\npost.save\npost.reload\npost.comments[0].subject # => 'New'\n\\# Changes were saved\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\nDestroy members marked for destruction, when saving the parent object\n</th>\n<td>\nNot applicable?\n</td>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost.comments.last.mark_for_destruction\npost.comments.last.marked_for_destruction? # => true\npost.comments.length # => 2\n\\# The model is _not_ yet removed from the database\npost.save\n\\# Now it is removed\npost.reload.comments.length # => 1\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nAnd this I think is the proposed behavior to be added:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<th>\nDisabled (default)\n</th>\n<th>\nEnabled\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\nAdding a new, previously-not-associated object (existing or new_record doesn't matter) to an association collection\n</th>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost = Post.first\npost.comments.count # => 1\npost.comments << [@new_comment1, @new_comment2]\n# The new comments are saved to the database IMMEDIATELY\npost.reload\npost.comments.count # => 3\n```\n</td>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost = Post.first\npost.comments.count # => 1\npost.comments << [@new_comment1, @new_comment2]\n# The new comments are not saved to the database yet\npost.save\npost.reload\npost.comments.count # => 3\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n\n<tr>\n<td>\n</td>\n<th>\nDisabled (default)\n</th>\n<th>\nEnabled\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<th>\nDeleting a member from that association\n</th>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost = Post.first\npost.comments.count # => 3\npost.comments.delete(post.comments[1])\n# The comment is deleted from the database IMMEDIATELY [? -- not tested]\npost.reload\npost.comments.count # => 2\n```\n</td>\n<td>\n``` ruby\npost = Post.first\npost.comments.count # => 3\npost.comments.delete(post.comments[1])\n# The comment is not deleted from the database yet\npost.reload\npost.comments.count # => 3\n```\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nTo summarize, I find that `:autosave => false` and `:autosave => true` make sense to describe the existing difference in behavior...\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>\nEnabled\n</th>\n<th>\nDisabled\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nChanges are not saved -- at all -- even when you call save on the parent object\n</td>\n<td>\nChanges are saved -- but only when you call save on the parent object\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\n...but somewhat unintuitive to describe the proposed new meaning:\n\n<table>\n<tr>\n<th>\nDisabled\n</th>\n<th>\nEnabled\n</th>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\nThe new objects are saved to the database (linked/associated with parent_object) IMMEDIATELY when added to association collection\n</td>\n<td>\nThe new objects are only saved to the database (linked/associated with parent_object) when you call save on the parent\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n\n\nIt seems to me like we're doing the exact _opposite_ of automatically saving in this case -- we're actually _deferring_ the automatic save (that would _normally_ happen) until later on.\n\nThe \"enabled\" column of both tables is similar enough, and I can sort of see why the name might make sense for that. \nBut in the \"_disabled_\" column of the one table, we're **not saving** at all and in the other, we're **saving immediately**.\n\nIt's not intuitive that `:autosave => false` would mean \"save immediately\".\n\nAnd the docs (at least the 2.3.5 docs -- couldn't find 3.0 docs) say:\n\n> Unless you set the :autosave option on a has_one, belongs_to, has_many, or has_and_belongs_to_many association [sentence incomplete]. Setting it to true will always save the members, whereas <u>setting it to false will never save the members</u>.\n\n## So, a different name?\n\nHere are some ideas...\n- `:deferred_save => true`\n- `:save => :when_parent_saved`\n- `:dont_link_records_until_parent_saved => true`\n\nOr...\n- Rename `:autosave => false` to `:save_existing => false`\n- Rename `:autosave => true` to `:save_existing => :when_parent_saved`\n- Add `:save_new_links => :immediately` (used for unlinks too) and `:save_new_links => :when_parent_saved`\n- (Yuck! I know...)\n\n## A tiny change to a test\n\n``` ruby\n  def test_should_have_pending_link_creations\n+   assert_equal 2, @pirate.send(@association_name).count\n    @pirate.send(@association_name) << [@new_child_1, @new_child_2]\n    assert_equal [@new_child_1, @new_child_2], @pirate.send(@association_name).pending_link_creations\n    @pirate.reload\n    assert_equal 2, @pirate.send(@association_name).count\n  end\n```\n\nI would suggest adding the first `assert_equal` so we can see what it is _before_ we start making changes (and see that it does not end up changing). (When I first read the test, I was assuming incorrectly that it started out at 0 and was _changed_ to 2 when [@new_child_1, @new_child_2] were added, but I was wrong since the setup method adds 2 records before we get here.)\n\n## Tiny question about accepts_nested_attributes_for\n\nCan you clarify what you mean by \"nothing happens to the links between those records and the owner of the association\" when you said:\n\n> The behaviour of `accepts_nested_attributes_for` is that you are able to modify and destroy the record on the other end of the association, nothing happens to the links between those records and the owner of the association.\n\nWhat _could_ or _should_ happen to those links? Your patch wouldn't even change anything about the way accepts_nested_attributes_for works, would it?  (Does accepts_nested_attributes_for even work with habtm? I don't recall.)\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:40:01", "user": 789801, "id": 1170041}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170042", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Lawrence Pit** - 2010-05-20 04:51:44 UTC\n\nTyler, thanks for your input. Below some answers.\n\n### mark_for_destruction\n\n+mark_for_destruction+ sets an instance var on a model instance, so it would destroy the instance. We don't want to destroy the instance, we only want to break the link between two model instances.\n\nFor example, suppose a pirate has many books and has many favorite_books. Suppose Book X is in both collections. If you want to remove Book X from the favorite_books collection, but not from the books collection, then you cannot use +mark_for_destruction+ on the Book X object, because a) you don't want it to disappear from both collections and b) you don't want to actually destroy Book X.\n\nTechnically speaking you'd want to do +mark_for_destruction+ on the object that sits between two model instances, in case of a habtm. However, such an object does not really exist in the rails implementation of habtm. Hence the need for +pending_link_deletions+.\n\nNote the subtle difference in case of a has_many. Suppose a Pirate has_many :birds, :autosave => true, and one of the birds in that collection is Tweety. The current behaviour is that you can call +mark_for_destruction+ on the Tweety object, and the bird will be killed when you call pirate.save. However, if you only want to release the bird without killing it, and defer this action until you call pirate.save, then this is currently not possible. The patch I've attached does make this possible.\n\nNote that the +pending_link_deletions+ and +pending_link_creations+ are extremely useful for validation purposes and for re-rendering views in a correct state in case validation fails.\n\n### accepts_nested_attributes_for\n\n+accepts_nested_attributes_for+ only CRUDs model instances. It does not CRUD links between model instances, it happens as a side effect when required. Specifically in the case of habtm I believe its implementation is flawed: it will update the attributes on the other end of the habtm relation or even delete the model instance on the other end. I don't think anyone would ever want to do that. What you want to do is link or unlink to/from a model instance on the other end, not modify it's attributes or destroy it.\n\n### intention of :autosave\n\n> My next question is, should the existing :autosave option be extended with this new behavior \n> or should a new option with a different name be used instead?\n\nA very good question. I believe the intention is the same. :autosave is really about deferring a save until the parent object is saved. That's exactly what I want. However, not only do I want to defer saves of changes to attributes on the other end of a has_many for example, but also I want to defer saves of changes made to what is and what is not included in an association collection.\n\n### rename :autosave ?\n\n> It seems to me like we're doing the exact opposite of automatically saving in this case -- we're \n> actually deferring the automatic save (that would normally happen) until later on.\n> [...]\n> It's not intuitive that :autosave => false would mean \"save immediately\".\n\nI totally agree. I always found the term \"autosave\" confusing. It's about deferring the save until the parent is saved.\n\n> :deferred_save => true\n\nThat would be my preference. But I leave this renaming exercise to another ticket.\n\n### Clarify test\n\nGood suggestion to clarify the test. Will do.\n\n### changes to accepts_nested_attributes_for ?\n\n> What could or should happen to those links?\n\nWhat I mean to explain is that accepts_nested_attributes_for does not allow you to link to an existing object nor does it allow to unlink from an existing object without destroying it.\n\nThe issue is however not with accepts_nested_attributes_for. I view accepts_nested_attributes_for as a sort of macro on top of the :autosave => true feature. I don't really need accepts_nested_attributes_for if all I want is deferred saves. Especially because accepts_nested_attributes_for is geared towards being a helper method for HTML form submissions, but it's unsuitable for e.g. XML or JSON submissions imo.\n\n> Your patch wouldn't even change anything about the way accepts_nested_attributes_for works, would it? \n\nMy patch changes nothing about the way accepts_nested_attributes_for works. All tests for accepts_nested_attributes_for are untouched.\n\nNote that when this patch is accepted it would be logical to add something like accepts_nested_attributes_for that works for linking/unlinking objects. That too is for a different ticket.\n\n> (Does accepts_nested_attributes_for even work with habtm?

This is because `ActionDispatch::Response` overrides `#body` (defined in `Rack::Response` with `attr_accessor`), and enumerates the body. Thus when `Rack::Response#close` calls `body.close`, a second execution is triggered.\n\nI think that `ActionDispatch::Response` should not override `body`. If it needs to force a string it should define `#body_text` or some other method with a name that makes it clear that it disables streaming.\n\nOn the subject of when or if response data is flushed, as far as I can tell it's entirely up to the Rack handler being used.

Basically html escaping is happening all the time in ActionView regardless of format.\n\nTemplates and Handlers always choose a ActionView::SafeBuffer or a subclass of it. This is desired behaviour in case of html (or alike, e.g.: xml) but not in any other context like plain text emails or csv.\n\nThe template should be smart enough to choose the correct buffer based on the format passed to it. E.g.: when the extension of a template is .text.haml it should not be doing any escaping, i.e. not be using the safe buffer.\n\nWe do think the priority of this bug should be high, as it's influencing all formats besides html, and thus breaking these.\n\nThe impact is probably going to be beyond rails, but in any rails3 compatible handler, like haml.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:44:48", "user": 789801, "id": 1170203}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170204", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Fjan** - 2010-11-11 15:25:22 UTC\n\nNow that my [patch to add a non-escaping option to Erubis](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5918-fix-erubis-non-escaping-sequence-patch) has been committed to 3.0 stable this problem can be fixed by simply letting the handler check if the template identifier contains \"html\" and disabling escape otherwise.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4896\nCreated by **Igor** - 2010-12-28 03:36:21 UTC\n\nRails (2.3.5 and it seems the same is with edge) with Ruby 1.9 correctly creates and stores utf-8 based routes. But when it comes to route recognition, it fails to match the route name:\n\n``` ruby\nmap.home '–Ω–∞—á–∞–ª–æ', controller: :home, action: :index\n```\n\nthen\nhttp://localhost/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE\ngives\n\n```\nNo route matches \"/%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%87%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%BE\" with {:method=>:get}\n```\n\nThe reason is that recognize_path does html unescape only after routes are mapped, and because of this it fails to map raw utf8 stored name against its %XX%XX equivalent.\n\nIn 2.3.5 the next patch fixes the issue:\n\n``` ruby\nrequire 'action_pack'\nrequire 'cgi'\nmodule ActionController::Routing\n  class RouteSet\n    alias_method :recognize_path_ugly, :recognize_path\n\n    def recognize_path(path, environment)\n      path = CGI::unescape(path).force_encoding('utf-8').encode(invalid: :replace)\n      recognize_path_ugly(path, environment)\n    end\n  end\nend \n```\n\nThe problem was introduced with http://dev.rubyonrails.org/changeset/6185 which basically tried to fix another issue. Actually fixing it with the above patch will break the current behaviour of parameters unescaping, so it should be carefully considered.\n\nThe similar issue was raised which also may interfere with this problem:\nhttps://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/2574-routing-double-escape-url-segments\n", "labels": [], "number": 688, "updated_at": "2011-06-29 01:54:27", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:02", "id": 904365, "title": "i18n routes can't be recognized", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/688", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:10", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170215", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Andrew White** - 2010-06-27 17:10:01 UTC\n\nWith the increasing support for IDN in browsers this is probably something we want to address.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:10", "user": 789801, "id": 1170215}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170216", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-08-30 03:10:33 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/27625)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:12", "user": 789801, "id": 1170216}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170218", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-10-15 22:01:56 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/31647)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:13", "user": 789801, "id": 1170218}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170220", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-16 01:42:12 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:15", "user": 789801, "id": 1170220}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170221", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2010-11-15 21:15:12 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/34353)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:17", "user": 789801, "id": 1170221}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170222", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-12 21:58:21 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/42275)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:19", "user": 789801, "id": 1170222}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170223", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-27 03:15:38 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/43692)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:20", "user": 789801, "id": 1170223}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1460432", "text": "It looks like the import from lighthouse scrapped many of the comments here.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/4961\nCreated by **Wade Stebbings** - 2011-02-17 06:48:08 UTC\n\nAlthough we have a unique situation with a single app connecting to two databases which also needs to perform joins across the two (mysql only), when setting this up we break migrations such that we see the following error:\n\n  Mysql::Error: Table 'schema_migrations' already exists: CREATE TABLE `istads_dev`.`schema_migrations` (`version` varchar(255) NOT NULL) ENGINE=InnoDB\n\nThis problem was first discovered on 2.3.5 and still exists on 2.3.8.  From what I can tell from code inspection, the problem is fixed on 3.0.\n\nI found the problematic line in:\n  lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/schema_statements.rb\nin the initialize_schema_migrations_table method, which first tries to detect if schema_migrations exists or not.  This check fails because it is comparing the items returned from the tables method (strings of table names, not prefixed/suffixed) with the return value from ActiveRecord::Migrator.schema_migrations_table_name (which, in our case, includes the database prefix).  The check always fails, even when schema_migrations exists, thus the code to recreate it is where the exception occurs.\n\nI've created a one-line patch which I have attached to this ticket.\n\nI have run the following rake tests with all tests passing:\n  test_mysql test_sqlite3 test_postgresql\n", "labels": [], "number": 690, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:02", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:02", "id": 904367, "title": "schema_migrations already exists error on db:migrate with two-database app", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/690", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:45:39", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170229", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Wade Stebbings** - 2010-06-24 21:10:11 UTC\n\nI have not yet created a unique unit-test for this issue, but I've started looking into it.\n\nTo recreate the problem, a part of the description which skimmed-over in the description above, I have these things going on in my rails app:\n- The app connects to two databases, one as the natural rails database, and one read-only metadata database which is quite huge.

To make the long story short, here's the distilled difference in behaviors of mysql and pg connection adapters:\n\nmysql:\n\n```\n\n> User.connection.quote('St√©phane').encoding\n=> #<Encoding:ASCII-8BIT>\n\n```\n\npg:\n\n```\n\n> User.connection.quote('St√©phane').encoding\n=> #<Encoding:ISO-8859-1>\n\n```\n\nI believe the root cause is in adapters' `quote_string` methods. Postgres adapter calls pg gem `escape` method which takes care of encodings:\n\n```\n\npg.c around line 1375:\n\n * Encoding of escaped string will be equal to client encoding of connection.\n\n```\n\nand mysql obviously doesn't do that (or at least mysql 2.8.1 gem doesn't do that for me).\n\nThe workaround may be to make `MysqlAdapter#quote_string` look more like this:\n\n```\n\n      def quote_string(string)\n        encoding = Encoding.find(@config[:encoding]) rescue nil\n        encoded_string = encoding ? string.encode(encoding) : string\n        quoted_string = @connection.quote(encoded_string)\n        encoding ? quoted_string.force_encoding(encoding) : quoted_string\n      end\n\n```\n\nWith some extra care for making `latin1` encoding alias or changing it to `iso-8859-1` in `database.yml`.\n\nBut I wonder if the issue should really be addressed in mysql gem code.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:46:24", "user": 789801, "id": 1170251}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170252", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Serge Balyuk** - 2010-07-06 16:03:14 UTC\n\nPlease find proposed patch based on the above. The `database.yml` should include another setting `ruby_encoding: iso-8859-1` for the `encoding: latin1` case. That's because I couldn't find any way to convince mysql to understand `iso-8859-1` name, and at the same time I didn't find a way to dynamically add encoding aliases in ruby (1.9.1).\n\nI understand that it's not the prettiest workaround, so I'm very open to suggestions.

Devise adds Warden middleware which is always present in `request.env` and which holds references to `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet`. The inspect output of `ActionDispatch::Routing::RouteSet` is huge when you have many routes (I get about ~3Mb diagnostics.erb output on that project).\n\nOne solution would be just to truncate output for every key in the `debug_hash` method of `_request_and_response.erb` partial.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:47:04", "user": 789801, "id": 1170271}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170272", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2010-11-15 21:04:51 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/34349)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:47:05", "user": 789801, "id": 1170272}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170273", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Nicolas Blanco** - 2011-01-03 14:48:18 UTC\n\nI confirm this problem and Evgeniy Dolzhenko explanation.\n\nOn my application, the template (_request_and_response.erb) takes 10 seconds to render.

These options have been added to the ActionDispatch Railtie and are called dump_session_on_error and dump_environment_on_error respectively. By default I've set the options to dump sessions but not the environment on error, since the session dump generally seems to be small while the environment dump can become huge as you add things like routes and plugins and extensions that like to add instance variables to the controller and such.\n\nI rarely ever find myself looking at the environment dump, so I'm not really going to miss it if it's gone by default, but it's nice being able to turn it back on again for the once-in-a-blue-moon that I would ever need to use it.\n\nThis might not be as pretty of a solution as truncating the values in the environment hash and such, but it's a quick fix for something that I doubt too many people really pay attention to anyways. I haven't included any tests in the patch as I'm not sure how to go about testing configuration options and templates like this, but I can add them if necessary and if anyone has any hints.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:47:12", "user": 789801, "id": 1170277}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170278", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **jay** - 2011-03-08 20:06:00 UTC\n\nI just realized that the patch above was against 3-0-stable, so here's a patch against master, too.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:47:13", "user": 789801, "id": 1170278}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170279", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Andy** - 2011-03-12 07:14:21 UTC\n\nI'm seeing what I think is the same problem as the original poster.

It shows up as `:formats=>[:\"hc/url;*/*\"]` in the exception output. I've captured this in a failing test in my app. Changing the semicolon to a comma 'solves' it, but I don't know enough about HTTP_ACCEPT parsing to know where the problem is.\n\nThe ws/ws header is \"`*/*, ws/ws`\", with the space, which parses to `:formats=>[:\"ws/ws\", :\"*/*\"]`, and the last is \"`text/*`\" by itself (`:formats=>[:\"text/*\"])`.\n\nThe action itself just sets a single instance var.\n\nForcing the format to html in a before filter as suggested isn't working for me.

The following appear quite often:\n- \"text/*\"\n- \"image/jpeg\", \"image/pjpeg\", \"image/png\", \"image/gif\"\n\nFor \"text/*\" Rails does not have any support, i.e. it does not recognize it.

I created a separate ticket for this, see: #6458.\n\nIn the second case Rails should return a 406 (Not Acceptable) if the respond_to block does not respond to any of the requested MIME types.

This remembers me the way Grails developers treat their issues. They provide GORM for ORM but rely on Hibernate and when there is some issue with GORM the mark the issue as \"won't fix\" because this is Hibernate fault, not Grails' as if the user had the chance to use another framework with GORM.\n\nI18n is the only supported way of adding internationalization support to Rails. It just happens that it is a separate gem that Rails is taking advantage of, but if i18n is broken in Rails it doesn't mean it is not Rails fault and that issues should be marked as invalid. If the i18n gem is not good enough for Rails (which is not the case), then should think in another way of getting i18n in Rails. Not simply telling it doesn't care about i18n and it won't try to fix any related issues even if the source isn't exactly in rails repository.\n\nBesides that, it is not clear to me that this is a i18n issue instead of a Rails one.

See the example below:\n\n``` ruby\nAccount.count(:all, :group => 'firm_id, credit_limit') # returns <OrderedHash {60=>1, 55=>1, 50=>1, 53=>1}>\n```\n\nThe example above demonstrates that the returned hash incorrectly excludes data rows and columns. See below for the expected return value:\n\n``` ruby\nAccount.count(:all, :group => 'firm_id, credit_limit') # should return <OrderedHash {[2, 60]=>1, [nil, 50]=>1, [9, 53]=>1, [6, 55]=>1, [1, 50]=>1, [6, 50]=>1}>\n```\n\nI have a attached a patch (test included) for supporting grouping by multiple fields. The behavior for grouping by a single field or an association is unchanged. Also, the :group option still takes in a string as always.\n", "labels": [], "number": 704, "updated_at": "2013-10-16 18:08:43", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:03", "id": 904384, "title": "ActiveRecord::Calculations returns incorrect data when grouping by multiple fields", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/704", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:49:54", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170363", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Sebastian** - 2010-09-11 02:27:33 UTC\n\nI just ported your patch to 3-0-stable: #497\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:49:55", "user": 789801, "id": 1170363}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170364", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeff Kreeftmeijer** - 2010-11-08 08:53:01 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:49:56", "user": 789801, "id": 1170364}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170365", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Alex** - 2010-11-18 18:39:14 UTC\n\nThis has been resolved, see #497 https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/497-activerecord-calculate-broken-for-multiple-fields-in-group-option\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:49:58", "user": 789801, "id": 1170365}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170366", "text": "Attachments saved to Gist: http://gist.github.com/971693\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:49:59", "user": 789801, "id": 1170366}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/26442607", "text": "I am using activerecord 3.2.14 and just experienced this issue when I included two fields in the same group statement:\n`group('id, another_table.field')`\n\nPlacing these in two separate group statements then produced the correct count.\n", "created_at": "2013-10-16 18:08:43", "user": 214311, "id": 26442607}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

It'll probably work fine in production mode or if you set config.cache_classes = true in config/environments/development.rb.\n\nIf you remove the require and include from the controller it should also work as the Gemfile should be loading RMagick anyway.

From the code:\n\n```\n  when Hash\n    if expected_partial = options[:partial]\n      if expected_locals = options[:locals]\n        actual_locals = @locals[expected_partial.to_s.sub(/^_/,'')]\n        expected_locals.each_pair do |k,v|\n          assert_equal(v, actual_locals[k])\n        end\n      elsif expected_count = options[:count]\n        actual_count = @partials[expected_partial]\n        msg = build_message(message,\n                \"expecting ? to be rendered ? time(s) but rendered ? time(s)\",\n                 expected_partial, expected_count, actual_count)\n        assert(actual_count == expected_count.to_i, msg)\n      elsif options.key?(:layout)\n        msg = build_message(message,\n                \"expecting layout <?> but action rendered <?>\",\n                expected_layout, @layouts.keys)\n\n        case layout = options[:layout]\n        when String\n          assert(@layouts.include?(expected_layout), msg)\n        when Regexp\n          assert(@layouts.any? {|l| l =~ layout }, msg)\n        when nil\n          assert(@layouts.empty?, msg)\n        end\n      else\n        msg = build_message(message,\n                \"expecting partial <?> but action rendered <?>\",\n                options[:partial], @partials.keys)\n        assert(@partials.include?(expected_partial), msg)\n      end\n    else\n      assert @partials.empty?,\n        \"Expected no partials to be rendered\"\n    end\n  end\n```\n\nNotice that the test for the \"layout\" param (elsif options.key?(:layout)) is nested within the check to see if you are testing for partials (if expected_partial = options[:partial]).\n\nIf I assume that this is correct behavior, which I don't think it should be, even if I pass in :partial => \"something\" then I get an error that says \"undefined local variable expected_layout\" because no where in assert_template does that variable get assigned.\n\nI have looked through master and have found some tests that seem to be testing this but I am not sure that they are working properly because if you don't pass in the :partial option then it ignores the three assertions that test the @layouts collection.\n\nPatches upcoming...\n", "labels": [], "number": 706, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:04", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:04", "id": 904386, "title": "assert_template wrong behavior for testing layout used to render template?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/706", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:50:12", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170369", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Mike Gehard** - 2010-07-30 14:40:14 UTC\n\nI have confirmed that assert_template does not work as you would expect and as the tests show in /actionpack/test/controller/layout_test.rb.\n\nExample:\nclass HasOwnLayoutController < LayoutTest\n\n# layout 'item'\n\n  layout 'item123'\nend\n\ndef test_layout_set_when_set_in_controller\n    @controller = HasOwnLayoutController.new\n    get :hello\n    assert_template :layout => \"layouts/item\"\n  end\n\nThis test still passes with the changed layout.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:50:13", "user": 789801, "id": 1170369}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170370", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Mike Gehard** - 2010-08-02 15:01:23 UTC\n\nHere is the patch that makes checking for layouts independent of checking for partials.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:50:14", "user": 789801, "id": 1170370}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170371", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jean** - 2010-08-15 19:31:51 UTC\n\nI confirm that I have this problem too. \n\nIntroduced here : http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/947f86c699b33bd44703b3554db58e4cfca37c86\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:50:15", "user": 789801, "id": 1170371}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170372", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jean** - 2010-08-18 12:09:00 UTC\n\nIs there a problem with the patch ? \n\nIt seems to work for me and in the meantime using the old way (@controller.response.layout) raises a deprecation warning which tells us to use template.layout instead.

I think the !anonymous? check should be in lookup_ancestors, or in a Sequel-specific override of lookup_ancestors.\n\nBTW, this example works for me:\n\n```\nclass Message < Sequel::Model\n  include ActiveModel::Validations\n\n  def text\n  end\n\n  validates :text, :presence => true, :length => { :within => 1..10000 }\nend\n\nMessage.new.valid?\n```\n\nI think you must be using something more like:\n\n```\nclass Message < Sequel::Model(:message)\n```\n\nWhich, if you are plugging Sequel's active_model plugin into Sequel::Model, will indeed cause Message.lookup_ancestors to return the anonymous class created by Sequel::Model(:message).\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:50:45", "user": 789801, "id": 1170393}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170394", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **gucki** - 2010-08-10 07:31:24 UTC\n\nWell, I guess the core team has to decide.

I no longer like my test case, because there's no guarantee that the record that is marked_for_deletion is actually going to be saved.  So in the general case of the target record being marked for deletion, I'm not sure this is a change that needs to be made.\n\nThe case that's more clear-cut is when an association is being saved and it contains items that are marked for deletion _and_ items that conflict with them in uniqueness.  In this case, we know both changes are going to happen (barring a transaction blowup or another validation failure).  I'd therefore focus on addressing this problem at the association save level, by ordering the child saves so that elements to be destroyed go first.\n\nDoes this seem like the right approach?  If so I'll rewrite the test case and take a shot at a patch.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:53:34", "user": 789801, "id": 1170490}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170491", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Javier Fernandez-Ivern** - 2010-08-20 14:02:39 UTC\n\nWell, I'm looking into resolving this, it's somewhat tricky (to me, at least) since I need to make it work when validating the association, not just when saving.

So validation for it doesn't run.

The API has changed but the documentation doesn't reflect the changes too clearly. Hopefully Yehuda can clarify this but essentially callbacks work as follows‚Ä¶\n\nThis will run only the before save callback‚Ä¶\n\n```\np = Post.new\np.run_callbacks(:save) { false }\n```\n\n‚Ä¶and this will run both the before and after callbacks‚Ä¶\n\n```\np = Post.new\np.run_callbacks(:save) { true }\n```\n\nEssentially you can't specify the before or after anymore (using #run_callbacks(:before_save) etc.) because callbacks work like this.\n\nYou call a group of callbacks, for example save, create, validation. There will potentially be a before and/or after callback to any of these groups. All will be executed but only if the block supplied evaluates to true. Examples will explain this better so here we go‚Ä¶\n\n```\n# Before and after callbacks\n# This will run both the before_save and after_save callbacks‚Ä¶\nPost.new.run_callbacks(:save)\n\n# ‚Ä¶as will this\nPost.new.run_callbacks(:save) { true }\n\n# This will only run the before_save and ignore any after_save callback\nPost.new.run_callbacks(:save) { false }\n```\n\nThis is darned handy if you have a condition that determines whether or not to execute the next callback as you do in ActiveRecord when saving (e.g. errors.empty?).\n\nI might be mistaken but after some debugging, source tasting and with some mad class/instance method magic I'm pretty sure this is how things work in Rails 3.\n\nAgain, if Mr. Katz or one of his learned friends could confirm this it would be appreciated.\n\nThanks.new.run_callbacks(:finished) { true }\n\nputs \"James ;)\"\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:53:58", "user": 789801, "id": 1170499}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170500", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Neeraj Singh** - 2010-08-28 03:25:10 UTC\n\nI recently fixed #5419 http://github.com/rails/rails/commit/2ffa50f5a9fac08e08869687006031b70322497a where after_validation was not getting called if valid? returns false.\n\nI will have to check with rails 2.3.x to see if what is the existing behavior.

Dalli is different from memcache-client in that it uses the new binary protocol in memcached 1.4 and supports managed environments like Heroku.  Its API is mostly compatible with memcache-client with some minor exceptions and it uses the exact same algorithm to select a server so gem migrations should not invalidate 100% of existing cache.\n\nI would like to discuss the changes necessary to remove/deprecate :mem_cache_store in favor of :dalli_store.  DalliStore is shipped with the dalli gem itself.

I think that's a convenience that's preventing this case from being possible.  Without being able to store the specific subclass in the database, it's impossible to do what I have outlined above.  I have run into this problem dozens of times, and several other people have as well (polymorphic sti problem in rails on google).\n\nRight now, if I were to do something like this, <code>Relationship.first.parent</code>, it would return a <code>#<Post title=...></code>, but it's supposed to be BlogPost.  There's a lot of other problems that arise from this.\n\nWhat was most surprising is by removing `base_class` from the HasManyThroughAssociation and HasManyAssociation classes, and adding that <code>OR</code> to the SQL, none of the activerecord tests broke.  So, for the following reasons, I think this should be integrated:\n1. Polymorphic Join Model in ActiveRecord currently does not support STI\n2. Which means your object will be improperly typed when retrieved from the database\n3.

A major impact that I don't think is considered so far is that we had to change every place that SQL conditions are generated for the _type column (e.g. associations.rb) instead of\n_type = base_class.name\nwe changed it to\n_type IN (self_and_sub_classes)\nwhere self_and_subclasses is a helper that returns self and its descendent classes.\n\nThis approach does have a major advantage though: we are aiming soon to being able to specify the subset of classes that a polymorphic association can refer to.  This will in turn allow us to\n1) include across a polymorphic association as long as all of the possible referenced classes resolve to the same table\n2) include across a polymorphic association when all of the possible referenced classes do not resolve to the same table, because at least we'll now know what tables it needs to be joined to.\n\nBoth of these can lead to a major performance increase by avoiding n+1 queries.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:56:02", "user": 789801, "id": 1170566}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170567", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jon Leighton** - 2010-12-21 18:21:15 UTC\n\nI have been playing with this today. Here's a half-written patch: https://github.com/jonleighton/rails/tree/5617_polymorphism_with_sti\n\nThe problem with this is it changes the way that the `polymorphic_type` field is used. This will break compatibility with existing databases.\n\nAlso, I have tried out something similar to the example where `Relationship.first.parent` returns a `Post` rather than a `BlogPost`. In my experimentation, the correct class was used. It is possible to get the correct class from the 'type' column of the 'posts' table.\n\nIf anyone can provide other concrete examples of why using the base class in the `polymorphic_type` field causes problems (other than being wrong from a theoretical perspective) then please say so and we can consider it, but for now the cost of breaking compatibility is too high I think.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:56:05", "user": 789801, "id": 1170567}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170568", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jonathan Monahan** - 2010-12-28 00:39:45 UTC\n\nYes, this is a breaking change for existing schemas that use polymorphism and STI together, but then I expect so was the change that provided the `store_full_sti_class` configuration.  This functionality could be wrapped similarly in a configuration option.\n\nI have tripped over this problem in so many guises that I gave up and changed our entire schema over to always store the precise STI class in all cases, both for the inheritance column and for polymorphic associations.\n\nAs for the argument that storing the base class allows the record to change class - I think that is a very esoteric application.  Assuming you treat database records as objects (you are using an ORM!) then in an OO world an object doesn't just change class!  I suspect that ActiveRecord was written that way originally because it was easiest, however in the long run it has caused me more pain.\n\nI guess that not many people worry about it because it doesn't cause much pain until you start building complex schemas with many polymorphic joins and plenty of STI.\n\nI'm afraid all of my concrete examples are just too complicated, or so simplistic that they would not help.\n\nIf anyone is interested, I will gladly spend some time to show the changes I made.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:56:08", "user": 789801, "id": 1170568}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170569", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jonathan Monahan** - 2010-12-28 00:52:16 UTC\n\nActually, I can think of an example, but it's a pretty obvious one.  Given the schema proposed above by @viatropos, you cannot query the database to find all `Relationships` that belong to a particular class.  You can query for all `Relationships` where the `child` is an `Image`, but you cannot find `Relationships` whose `parent` is a `BlogPost`.  To do that you'd have to load each and every `Post` that is referred to as a `parent` and then check that it becomes a `BlogPost` in memory.\n\nThat's not very orthogonal, and terribly inefficient, especially if all you wanted to do was count the `Relationships`!\n\nSure you could do it more efficiently in SQL, but then why use an ORM?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:56:12", "user": 789801, "id": 1170569}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170570", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jon Leighton** - 2011-01-01 17:33:05 UTC\n\nHi,\n\nThat's a good point, maybe I was too quick to wontfix this. It would be theoretically possible to JOIN the relevant table conditional on its `type` column, but you're right that this is a nasty solution and it's made less straightforward by the polymorphism (how to decide what to JOIN?)\n\nI'm up for fixing this and I have some thoughts about how to make it a smooth transition, so I'm going to open it back up for now. When I have an opportunity (probably not for a while as I'm working on other stuff atm) I'll send some thoughts around the rails-core list.\n\nJon\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:56:15", "user": 789801, "id": 1170570}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170571", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Paul K** - 2011-02-13 18:00:06 UTC\n\nI'm also one looking for this functionality to be in Rails as my projects depend on it.

Once you have other routes the :format key drops out of generation_keys due to the increased frequency of the :controller and :action keys.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:26", "user": 789801, "id": 1170602}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170603", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeremy Kemper** - 2010-10-15 22:02:03 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/31647)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:28", "user": 789801, "id": 1170603}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170604", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-16 01:22:19 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:29", "user": 789801, "id": 1170604}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170605", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Ryan Bigg** - 2010-10-19 07:35:31 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:31", "user": 789801, "id": 1170605}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170606", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2010-11-15 21:15:12 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/34353)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:32", "user": 789801, "id": 1170606}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170607", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-12 21:58:22 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/42275)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:34", "user": 789801, "id": 1170607}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170608", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-27 03:15:39 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/43692)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:35", "user": 789801, "id": 1170608}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170609", "text": "Attachments saved to Gist: http://gist.github.com/971709\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 03:57:37", "user": 789801, "id": 1170609}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

This helps us prevent silent failure. \n\nI'm in the process of porting our app to Rails 3, and spent some time today reimplementing this monkey-patch on WhiteList and BlackList. \n\nUpon doing so, I discovered an unexpected failure when accessing an association after building instances on the association. It turns out that AssociationCollection#load_target performs mass-assignment calls (#attributes=) to update non-dirty, non-id fields on the in-memory instances.\n\nI'm pretty sure that this call to #attributes= should bypass mass-assignment protection, since it's assigning values from the database to in-memory instances. I'm proposing to change:\n\n``` ruby\n@target.delete_at(i).tap do |t|\n  keys = [\"id\"] + t.changes.keys + (f.attribute_names - t.attribute_names)\n  t.attributes = f.attributes.except(*keys)\nend\n```\n\nto:\n\n``` ruby\n@target.delete_at(i).tap do |t|\n  keys = [\"id\"] + t.changes.keys + (f.attribute_names - t.attribute_names)\n  t.send(:attributes=, f.attributes.except(*keys), false)\nend\n```\n\nI'm pretty sure this should be an uncontroversial change, and I'd love to see it patched in ActiveRecord.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5917\nCreated by **James MacAulay** - 2010-11-04 16:15:12 UTC\n\nThe problem comes from ticket [#3164](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/3164), which ended up as commit [6361d42](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/6361d4234ca7f7c2dcb98e6ed34187d2933b56d7).\n\nIts concern was with `AR::B#clone`, but it had the side effect of giving `dup` almost exactly the same behaviour as `clone`, since both methods call `initialize_copy` as a hook in ruby.\n\nAs a result, these are the main changes to duped records in Rails 3.0:\n- `new_record` is set to true\n- dirty tracking is set so that all attributes with non-default values are considered changed\n\nBecause `dup` itself also has a custom implementation which duplicates the attributes hash _after_ `initialize_copy` is called, the behaviour of `clone` to remove the primary key was _not_ carried over to `dup`. This combination of things means that, for example, you can't save a dup of a persisted record:\n\n``` ruby\n    >> Shop.first.dup.save\n    ActiveRecord::RecordNotUnique: Mysql::Error: Duplicate entry '2' for key 1: INSERT INTO `shops` ...\n```\n\nThe error is raised because Active Record looks at `new_record`, sees that it's true, decides to use an INSERT instead of an UPDATE, and the INSERT tries to save a primary key which already exists.\n\nIn Rails 2.x, `clone` was used to create copies intended to be saved as new records, while `dup` was a simpler operation which made a more direct (but still shallow) copy of the object. Both methods would remove the frozen state of the original.\n\nNotes on the patch:\n\nThe provided patch brings `dup` back in line with its old behaviour, while maintaining the improvements made to `clone` which still seem to make sense. One minor improvement to `clone` was made as well, to set its `previous_changes` to an empty hash (since it doesn't make any sense for it to keep the hash from the original). Tests have been added both to establish new behaviour and clarify existing behaviour. Many of the dup tests were just copied from the clone tests with minor changes.\n\nThe weirdest aspect of the patch is that it checks `RUBY_VERSION` in a few places. This is ugly, I know. Basically I wanted people to still be able to override initialize_copy in the same way that the [original ticket](https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994-ruby-on-rails/tickets/3164) intended, while also providing different behaviour for `clone` and `dup`. I thought an `initialize_dup` method would be a good thing to have, and then found that ruby 1.9 already has it. (Ruby 1.9 will first look for `initialize_clone` or `initialize_dup` as appropriate, and only fall back to `initialize_copy` if the more specific hook is not implemented.) So the checks on `RUBY_VERSION` are there so that `initialize_copy` is run exactly once, followed by `initialize_clone`/`initialize_dup` exactly once, regardless of ruby version. If the checks weren't there, then one method or another would be called twice, dependent on ruby version.\n\nI can think of a few alternate ways to handle this, by sacrificing a little bit of backwards compatibility and/or ruby version compatibility for the sake of cleaner code.\n", "labels": [], "number": 745, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:08", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:08", "id": 904441, "title": "[PATCH] ActiveRecord::Base#dup changed drastically in 3.0, should be brought back to 2.x behaviour ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/745", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:20", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170720", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jeff Kreeftmeijer** - 2010-11-08 08:27:42 UTC\n\nAutomatic cleanup of spam.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:21", "user": 789801, "id": 1170720}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170721", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aaron Patterson** - 2010-11-23 01:14:33 UTC\n\n@James, would you mind rebasing this patch from 3-0-stable, and I'll apply it?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:22", "user": 789801, "id": 1170721}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170722", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-12 21:58:22 UTC\n\n[[bulk edit](http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/bulk_edits/42275)]\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:24", "user": 789801, "id": 1170722}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170723", "text": "Attachments saved to Gist: http://gist.github.com/971722\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:25", "user": 789801, "id": 1170723}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

Not sure what the solution is, but I got around it as follows:\n\n``` ruby\n  def setup\n    routes = Rails.application.routes\n    routes.disable_clear_and_finalize = true\n    routes.clear!\n    Rails.application.routes_reloader.paths.each { |path| load(path) }\n    routes.draw do\n      match \"/test-action\" => \"my_controller_test/test#index\"\n    end\n    routes.disable_clear_and_finalize = false\n    routes.finalize!\n  end\n\n  def teardown\n    Rails.application.reload_routes!\n  end\n```\n\nBut this is clearly upsetting.  Perhaps the with_routing helper from ActionDispatch::Assertions::RoutingAssertions could be updated to work in 2 ways.  The default is to work as it does now, where the routes defined in the block are the only available ones.  The 2nd mode (or new helper) would provide routing that keeps the existing app routes around and adds those in the block to them.  Both modes should reset back to the default app routes at the end of the block.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:43", "user": 789801, "id": 1170729}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

You'd then get:\n\n``` ruby\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"character_set_client\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8\"},\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"character_set_connection\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8\"},\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"character_set_database\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8\"},\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"character_set_results\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8\"},\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"character_set_server\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8\"},\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"character_set_system\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8\"},\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"collation_connection\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8_general_ci\"}\n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"collation_database\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8_unicode_ci\"}, \n {\"Variable_name\"=>\"collation_server\", \"Value\"=>\"utf8_unicode_ci\"}\n```\n\nI.e., the collation_connection value is still using a wrong value in this case (it's value is always the default collation for the character set of the connection, in this case of the utf8 character set).\n\nThe only solution I see is by patching the +configure_connection+ method of the mysql adapter.\n\nThere are two options:\n1. Instead of doing SET NAMES 'utf8' it should be possible to do SET NAMES 'utf8' COLLATE 'utf8_unicode_ci'. For this I propose the +configure_connection+ method should (re)use the :charset and :collation values from database.yml (in favor of :encoding), just like the databases rake tasks do.\n2. Instead of doing SET NAMES 'utf8' it should do SET CHARACTER SET 'utf8'. In that case the collation_connection value will be set to the value of collation_database.\n\nWhich option is preferable?\n", "labels": [], "number": 748, "updated_at": "2014-09-25 21:35:36", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:09", "id": 904444, "title": "mysql collation_connection gets wrong value", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/748", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:01:50", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170730", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Santiago Pastorino** - 2011-02-06 21:01:38 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

At some point Rails started relying on this behavior so it seems appropriate to move it to ActiveSupport (where people most likely will look for such extensions). \n\nIn I18n itself we're going to not rely on this patch anymore but implement our own version of I18n.interpolate, mostly in order to get rid of warnings (and in debug mode exceptions) that are raised when optional interpolation variables are passed. (Optional interpolation variables are something we absolutely need in I18n but seems to be seen as a wrong usage of sprintf by Ruby core.)\n\nHere's a patch that moves this functionality to ActiveSupport:\n\nhttps://github.com/svenfuchs/rails/commit/85a05662fe7e0b06e9c7cd93cae9c3721058d879\n\nI'm not really sure about how to properly attribute Masao's work in a case like this.

Martin Gogov noted this in #4554 and I believe this is related (but not the same issue).\n\nThe relevant `Rack::Response` code is (http://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/response.rb#L102-104):\n    def close\n      body.close if body.respond_to?(:close)\n    end\n\nThis patch just adds a `close` method to `ActionDispatch::Response` which will delegate it to `@body` instead of `#body`, avoiding the double call of the proc.\n\nPutting a breakpoint inside my proc shows the following stacktraces... **The first time:**\n\n(rdb:4) w\n--> #0 ActionDispatch::Response.each \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/actionpack-3.0.3/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb:35\n    #1 ActionDispatch::Response.each \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/actionpack-3.0.3/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb:152\n    #2 Rack::Handler::WEBrick.service(req#WEBrick::HTTPRequest, res#WEBrick::HTTPResponse,...) \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/rack-1.2.1/lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:64\n    #3 WEBrick::HTTPServer.service(req#WEBrick::HTTPRequest, res#WEBrick::HTTPResponse,...) \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httpserver.rb:111\n    #4 WEBrick::HTTPServer.run(sock#TCPSocket) \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httpserver.rb:70\n    #5 at line /Users/doug/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/server.rb:183\n\n**And the second time:**\n\n(rdb:4) w\n--> #0 ActionDispatch::Response.each \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/actionpack-3.0.3/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb:35\n    #1 ActionDispatch::Response.each \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/actionpack-3.0.3/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb:152\n    #2 ActionDispatch::Response.body \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/actionpack-3.0.3/lib/action_dispatch/http/response.rb:101\n    #3 Rack::Response.close \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/rack-1.2.1/lib/rack/response.rb:102\n    #4 Rack::Handler::WEBrick.service(req#WEBrick::HTTPRequest, res#WEBrick::HTTPResponse,...) \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.9.2-p0/gems/rack-1.2.1/lib/rack/handler/webrick.rb:68\n    #5 WEBrick::HTTPServer.service(req#WEBrick::HTTPRequest, res#WEBrick::HTTPResponse,...) \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httpserver.rb:111\n    #6 WEBrick::HTTPServer.run(sock#TCPSocket) \n       at line /Users/doug/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/httpserver.rb:70\n    #7 at line /Users/doug/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.2-p0/lib/ruby/1.9.1/webrick/server.rb:183\n", "labels": [], "number": 758, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:10", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:10", "id": 904457, "title": "[PATCH] response_body proc is called twice", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/758", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:04:06", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170797", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **rails** - 2011-02-22 00:00:18 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6062\nCreated by **Jeremy Evans** - 2010-11-25 07:22:05 UTC\n\nActiveSupport assumes that DateTime inherits certain methods from Date, such as -.  This is true in the standard library (where dates are stored as datetimes), but not true in home_run.  I think ActiveSupport should be changed so that any methods that are overridden in Date should not be assumed to be automatically overridden in DateTime, so that you are sure that DateTime objects have the same behavior.  I believe that ActiveSupport overrides the following methods in Date and assumes they will be overridden in DateTime: +, -, >>.\n\nRemoving the methods from DateTime or defining them to call super will not work, because the behavior for DateTime could be different from Date (and is in home_run).  However, just adding the following to the DateTime core extension should work:\n\n```\nclass DateTime\n  alias_method :plus_without_duration, :+\n  alias_method :+, :plus_with_duration\n  alias_method :minus_without_duration, :-\n  alias_method :-, :minus_with_duration\nend\n```\n\nFor >>, you should probably do something similar, like defining a new method and aliasing instead of undefing, even if you don't call the previous method.  That's less of an issue, though, as you aren't changing behavior.  You aren't going to effect home_run's DateTime class, but as it doesn't suffer from the bug you are trying to fix, it doesn't matter much.\n\nSee https://gist.github.com/714891 for a gist of the problem.

Bedard** - 2011-02-19 09:28:28 UTC\n\nGiven the following associated models:\n\n```\nclass Client < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :orders\nend\n\nclass Order < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :client\nend\n```\n\nAnd let's say I have an orders controller in which a Client creates their orders:\n\n```\nclass OrdersController < ApplicationController\n  def create\n    @client.orders.create(params[:order])\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThis mass-assignment, in Rails 2.X.X, would always ensure that the Order Object belonged to the association owner, by forcing the foreign key (`client_id`) to that of `@client`.\n\nWith Rails 3.0.3, the behavior has changed, making it possible to inject a foreign key simply by setting it. So, in this example, if `params[:order]` happens to have a `:client_id` key, that value will override the associations's owner id. In other words, the AR scope that is specified by `@client.orders` doesn't enforce itself when creating associated objects.\n\nThis may also represent a \"security\" vulnerability, as anyone can easily infer the foreign key column name (Rails makes it pretty easy) and inject a value submitted in a form, that can create objects belonging to other objects that should not be acessible in this way.\n\nAlso, calling `@client.orders.build(params[:order])` does enforce the correct scope attributes (as would be expected).\n\nI am not familiar with the internals of the new AR querying interface, but having investigated a bit, it all seems to originate in `ActiveRecord::Base#with_scope`, where improper merging of attributes occurs with construct_scope attributes.\n", "labels": [], "number": 769, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:12", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:11", "id": 904469, "title": "ActiveRecord Association Proxy/Collection create method incorrectly merges attributes", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/769", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:06:33", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170860", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **C. Bedard** - 2010-11-30 19:59:28 UTC\n\nMore on this issue:\n\nI initially thought the problem was in `ActiveRecord::Base#with_scope` but now after more digging, I found out the problem originates in `ActiveRecord::Base#initialize`, where 2 lines should be reversed in order for scope attributes to be assigned _after_ the attributes Hash that is received as a parameter. Currently the method goes like this:\n\n```\ndef initialize(attributes = nil)\n  ....\n  ....      \n  ensure_proper_type\n\n  # THE FOLLOWING 2 LINES SHOULD BE REVERSED!\n  populate_with_current_scope_attributes\n  self.attributes = attributes unless attributes.nil?\n\n  result = yield self if block_given?\n  _run_initialize_callbacks\n  result\nend\n```\n\nThe reason is simple: as it is right now, the scope attributes are first assigned, but then attributes are **overwritten with the attributes Hash passed as a parameter**. Reversing those to lines solves the problem. \n\nAttached is the patch acting on `ActiveRecord::Base#initialize`, which simply assigns scope attributes after the attributes parameter, therby enforcing the scope attributes over the parameter attributes.\n\nThis is, by the way, the way it was done in Rails 2. Maybe there is a reason for this in Rails 3, but it is not readily apparent.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:06:34", "user": 789801, "id": 1170860}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170861", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Mike Ragalie** - 2010-12-04 19:28:36 UTC\n\nI confirm that this bug exists in edge. And it is potentially a problem, since I can see someone doing something like this:\n\n``` ruby\npost = Post.where(:title => \"My Favorite Things\")\npost_dup = Post.where(:title => \"My Favorite Thingz\")\n\ncomment = post_dup.comments.first\npost.comments.create(comment.attributes)\n```\n\nHowever, the above patch breaks other AR functionality (some of the tests fail) so I created tests for the problem and I've attached a new fix that passes all tests. In short, the build methods on has_one/has_many call #set_belongs_to_association_for but the create methods do not. I refactored the has_one create methods to operate similarly to the has_many create methods and added in a call to #set_belongs_to_association_for for both association types.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:06:35", "user": 789801, "id": 1170861}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170862", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jesse Storimer** - 2011-01-29 04:01:33 UTC\n\n+1 for Mike's patch.

I don't see anything in the ActiveSupport::WeakHashMap or the Weakling code that would indicate there was a problem with how WeakRef itself is implemented. They both seem to be doing the same thing internally the WeakRef is doing.\n\nThis patch doesn't need a weak hash map or a reference queue so I think it should be fine with WeakRef. The weak reference exist only to support the callbacks that reset the state of new or deleted objects if the transaction fails. If the objects have been garbage collected because there are no hard references to them, then there is no need to invoke these callbacks.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:21:45", "user": 789801, "id": 1170942}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170943", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aaron Patterson** - 2010-12-13 18:43:27 UTC\n\nThe problem is that WeakRef uses `_id2ref` to look up an object.  `_id2ref` takes an object id, and returns the object corresponding with that id.  The problem is that object ids are not unique in MRI, the get reused.  That means that you could get back an object that isn't the object you were actually looking for.\n\nWe can easily demonstrate id reuse like so:\n\n```\nclass Foo; end\nclass Bar; end\n\nid_to_class = {}\n\nloop do\n  obj = [Foo, Bar].sort_by { rand }.first.new\n\n  if id_to_class.key? obj.object_id\n    puts \"obj id: #{obj.object_id} was reused\"\n\n    if id_to_class[obj.object_id] != obj.class\n      puts \"omg! they aren't even the same class!\"\n    end\n  end\n\n  id_to_class[obj.object_id] = obj.class\nend\n```\n\nNow imagine that two AR objects had object_ids that collided.\n\nI hesitate to apply this patch because of this problem.

Object ids are not reused in Jruby, Rubinius, or IronRuby so WeakRefs do work properly (makes sense since these all run on a VM).\n2. Object ids are reused in MRI 1.8.7 and REE 1.8.7 do reuse object ids, but the WeakRef implementation handles that case properly because of the single system thread the process is running on.\n3. Object ids are reused in MRI 1.9.2 but the WeakRef implementation does not handle this properly since the garbage collector can run concurrently with threads allocating new objects. This messes up cleanup logic since finalizers attached to an object id can be run after that object id has been assigned to a new object.\n4. The WeakRef implementation does not scale on most runtimes. Performance on MRI 1.8.7, REE 1.8.7, and IronRuby is especially bad (performance on Rubinius is actually good, though). For some reason it extends Delegator which redefines all of the wrapped object's methods on initialization. This is both expensive on the CPU and can take up a lot of memory. On MRI 1.8.7 creating an array of 50,000 WeakRefs that wrap Object.new will balloon the heap to well over 1GB and creating each WeakRef takes 15-100 times longer to do. I have no idea why you would want to use a Delegator on a WeakRef unless you want your code to randomly break when the garbage collector kicks in, but it just doesn't seem worth it.\n5. The weakling gem provides a better WeakRef implementation for Jruby that uses the native Java weak references.\n\nSince WeakRef is either broken or performs horribly on 5 of the 6 Ruby runtimes I tested, and it is a really useful feature to have, I think it makes sense to add it to ActiveSupport so we can have a consistent working interface for weak references. Unfortunately, easier said than done. I started out simply reimplementing WeakRef to make it not extend Delegator and fix the bugs with 1.9. However, Jruby has it's own better implementation and since Rubinius has a very efficient implementation of WeakRef, but doesn't perform at all well with finalizers. Thus, I ended up with three different implementations of WeakReference and the runtime picks the best choice:\n1. Jruby uses one backed by Weakling if it is available otherwise it uses one backed by WeakRef\n2. Rubinius uses the implementation backed by WeakRef\n3. All other runtimes use my reimplementation of WeakRef\n\nThe interface is very simple:\n\n```\nobj = Object.new\nref = ActiveSupport::WeakReference.new(obj)\nref.object                # obj or nil if the reference has been reclaimed\nref.referenced_object_id  # obj.object_id\n```\n\nFurther, I used this implementation to create a WeakHash class where the values are weak references. This could be used to replace the WeakHash shown in the commit linked to above for the identity map stuff.\n\nAttached is a new patch with the original ActiveRecord changes along with the WeakReference implementations. Also attached is my test script in case anyone wants to verify the bizarre weak reference hell I've stumbled into. To run the test script, simply run it with your favorite flavor of ruby and pass one of object, weakref, or weakreference as the argument:\n\n```\nruby weakref_test.rb object         # baseline object creation without weak references\nruby weakref_test.rb weakref        # uses WeakRef\nruby weakref_test.rb weakreference  # uses new ActiveSupport::WeakReference\n```\n\nEach test will report on how long it takes to create 1000 instances of the specified class and then will run 100,000 iterations trying to find reused object id's. Be careful if you run the weakref tests under MRI, REE, or IronRuby because your process heap will grow to 2+GB and your computer may become severely unresponsive.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:21:48", "user": 789801, "id": 1170944}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170945", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Aaron Patterson** - 2010-12-16 03:43:52 UTC\n\n@Brian Excellent work!

But the point of weak refs is that it can, and a nondeterministic solution is off the cards.\n\nSo I think we¬†would need to have a way of declaring somewhere that for this transaction or this record save we don't care about rolling back object states if the transaction is rolled back later.

For me, it seems that MySQL doesn't want to retrieve any records, while trying to do something like (codes from head):\n\n``` ruby\nPost.all(\n  :joins      => \"LEFT JOIN view_logs ON posts.id = view_logs.post_id\",\n  :conditions => { :view_logs => { :user_id => [1, 2, nil] }\n}\n```\n\nThe need to retrieve using `nil` may appear when using, for example `LEFT JOIN`, where associated records with nulls may appear. I believe, the _true_ retrieve of records with nulls in terms of SQL should look like\n\n``` sql\nview_logs.user_id IS NULL\n```\n\nThus, I believe, the above `Post.all(...)` retrieval should generate the following SQL piece:\n\n``` sql\n... WHERE (view_logs.user_id IN (1, 2) OR view_logs.user_id IS NULL)\n```\n\nI've made an Arel patch to fix the issue, as well as a patch with a couple of Rails test to check the behavior.

To manage it we created a nice little gem to handle it. Basically the gem was just a collection of ActiveRecord models, nicely namespaced, so that we could include it in any application that made have needed access to that db.  In code outside of Rails, where we commonly used the gem we would just do this,\n\n``` ruby\n  require 'legacy_database'\n  LegacyDatabase::Base.establish_connection(...)\n```\n\nUsing ActiveRecord 3 this no longer works when used outside of Rails. \n\n``` ruby\n  require 'legacy_database' # <= raises ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished\n  LegacyDatabase::Base.establish_connection(...)\n```\n\nThe backtrace showed us that when the gem was being loaded when it hits the first scope call Arel attempts to connect to the database. Its a classic chicken/egg situation. You can't initialize the connection until you load the gem and you can't load the gem without initializing the connection.\n\nIn our situation we aren't using the gem in concert with any other ActiveRecord connections so we are able to use ActiveRecord::Base to establish the connection.\n\n``` ruby\n  require 'activerecord'\n  ActiveRecord::Base.establish_connection(...)\n  require 'legacy_database'\n  LegacyDatabase::Foo.find(1)  # It work's\n```\n\nThis naturally is not an ideal situation.\n", "labels": [], "number": 783, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:14", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:13", "id": 904516, "title": "ActiveRecord scope class method requires a database connection", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/783", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:23:25", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170991", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Nick** - 2011-01-14 10:56:56 UTC\n\nI've just come across this issue in another project where we manually require AR + all the models, then establish the connection some time afterwards.\n\nMy workaround is a class method encapsulating an anonymous scope, e.g.\n\nclass Foo\n  def self.online\n    self.scoped.joins(:bar).where(:bars => {:disconnected_at => nil})\n  end\nend\n\nSince AR/Arel can't validate such anonymous scopes at require-time, it gets around the problem. It does raise the question of exactly how useful that validation is, though. Obviously, they could just defer it until require_connection is called if there's no connection at require time - but maybe it's not useful and should just be quietly dropped in favour of an error at runtime when you try to use a named scope referencing an invisible table?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:23:25", "user": 789801, "id": 1170991}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170992", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Peer Allan** - 2011-03-08 14:30:02 UTC\n\nMy original post described a workaround for when you are encountering this problem outside a Rails app.  Since then I have tried to work around this in a couple more ways in a Rails 3 application and am not having much luck.  Our legacy gem is formatted very much like ActiveRecord\n\n``` ruby\nmodule LegacyDatabase\n  class Base < ActiveRecord::Base\n    establish_connection :legacy_database # <= important line\n  end\nend\n```\n\nIf we leave the establish_connection in the gem then we get a configuration not found error. (legacy_database database is not configured (ActiveRecord::AdapterNotSpecified))\n\nIf we remove that line then the app starts to load the models that are contained in the gem.  However, once it hits an association, for example:\n\n``` ruby\nmodule LegacyDatabase\n  class Foo < Base\n    has_and_belongs_to_many :bars\n  end\nend\n```\n\nWe get a ActiveRecord::ConnectionNotEstablished error.  Here is the important part of the backtrace:\n\n```\nfrom /user/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p334/gems/activerecord-3.0.5/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_specification.rb:97:in `retrieve_connection'\nfrom /user/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p334/gems/activerecord-3.0.5/lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/connection_specification.rb:89:in `connection'\nfrom /user/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p334/gems/activerecord-3.0.5/lib/active_record/associations.rb:1804:in `create_has_and_belongs_to_many_reflection'\nfrom /user/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p334/gems/activerecord-3.0.5/lib/active_record/associations.rb:1411:in `has_and_belongs_to_many'\nfrom /user/me/.rvm/gems/ruby-1.8.7-p334/gems/activerecord-3.0.5/lib/active_record/autosave_association.rb:137:in `has_and_belongs_to_many'\n```\n\nAt this point, we have exhausted all avenues that we can think of, to get around this.

Attempt to load it into a Rails 3 application and you will see the errors.  Detailed instructions are shown below and included in the legacy_database.rb file.  There are 3 scenarios listed in terms of importance.\n\nThree things can be tested by including this gem in your app\n1. scope calls will attempt to connect to the database before a \n   connection has been established\n2. has_and_belong_to_many associations in the models will attempt to\n   connect to the database before a connection has been established\n3. an establish_connection in the Base class as shown below will\n   not work regardless of database.yml settings. Although, setting\n   a gem up this way is probably not useful anyway ;)\n\nInstructions:\n1. Include this gem in your rails 3 app's Gemfile\n   gem 'legacy_database', :path => '/path/to/legacy_database'\n2. bundle install the gem\n\nScenario 1\n1) comment out the habtm lines in foo.rb and bar.rb\n2) ensure the scope line in baz.rb is not commented out\n3) attempt to load the console\n\nScenario 2\n1) comment out scope in baz.rb\n2) Ensure the habtm lines in bar.rb and foo.rb are not commented out\n3) attempt to load the console\n\nScenario 3\n1) uncomment the 'establish_connection' line in this file and attempt\nto load a console\n2) add a legacdy_database config to your database.yml and load the console\n\nI also tested it with a \"has_many\" and a \"has_many :through\" relationships which did not cause the same problem. Therefore the workaround if a habtm is required is that you have to use a \"has_many :through\".  That said, the association issues and establish_connection are only related side effects. Its the problem that primarily affects us (so now we have a workaround, yay!). The scope issues is the big fish in this ticket.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:23:31", "user": 789801, "id": 1170994}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1170995", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Jon Leighton** - 2011-03-08 18:22:58 UTC\n\nIt's caused by this line:\n\nhttps://github.com/rails/rails/blob/3-0-stable/activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb#L1804\n\nThat test and the preceding one ought to be in AssociationReflection#check_validity!

A self-contained test example is attached.  Observed in Ruby 1.9.2 / Rails 3.0.0\n\nThe general synopsis:\n\nA RefThing table has two fks: obj1_id and obj2_id.  The following method correctly create a RefThing and returns 1:\n\n```\ndef works(obj1, obj2)\n  relation1 = RefThing.where(:obj1_id => obj1.id)\n  relation1.where(:obj2_id => obj2.id).create\n  relation1.size\nend\n```\n\nThe following method returns zero instead, even though it correctly creates a RefThing.

But now that there is a `.downcase` on the model name **after** the i18n lookup, it's prohibitively hard to override.\n\nThe only way I can think of to override that default value now is in the view:\n\n``` erb\n  <%= f.submit t('helpers.actions.create', model: f.object.model_name.human) %>\n```\n\nIf only that would work it would be bad enough, but the key `helpers.actions.create` needs to be chosen dynamically depending on the form action.\n\nI might definitely be missing something (and that would be a good thing! :) But as it stands, every developer upgrading to Rails 5 will have their i18n definition overridden by these changes. All feature specs trying to click on a button will fail and a lot of un-DRY code would have to be added to every form view. (That's what happened to me, at least, so I'm monkey patching in production to revert this PR).\n\nI'm not exactly sure what the correct solution would be.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6211\nCreated by **Orion Delwaterman** - 2010-12-22 22:01:58 UTC\n# Summary\n\nWhen an association with conditions is chained together with additional conditions using Relations, ActiveRecord and Arel shifts the association's conditions from the `WHERE` clause to the `ON` clause. But in doing so it drops the foreign key relationship and improperly quotes conditions. Quick example:\n\n``` ruby\n   Post.includes(:special_tags).where(:user_id => 10).all\n```\n\nwill result in the following SQL (using sqlite3):\n\n``` sql\n  SELECT \"posts\".\"id\" as t0_r0, \"posts\".\"title\" AS t0_r0, \"user_id\" AS t0_r1, \"tags\".\"id\" AS t1_r0, \"tags\".\"post_id\" AS t1_r1, \"tags\".\"name\" AS t1_r2, \"tags\".\"context_type\" AS t1_r3\n  FROM \"posts\" \n  LEFT OUTER JOIN \"taggings\" ON \"posts\".\"id\" = \"taggings\".\"post_id\" \n  LEFT OUTER JOIN \"tags\" ON \"tags\".\"name\" = ''special''\n  WHERE \"posts\".\"id\" = 10\n```\n\nThere are two issues with the second `LEFT OUTER JOIN` statement. First its missing the foreign key relationship condition `\"taggings\".\"tag_id\" = \"tags\".\"id\"`. Second it's improperly double quoting (two single quotes on each side) the word \"special\" with `\"tags\".\"name\" = ''special''`\n# Recreating the issue\n\nThis is a modified version of our code at work where we originally discovered the issue.\n\nSchema:\n\n```\ncreate_table \"recipes\", :force => true do |t|\n  t.string   \"name\"    \nend\ncreate_table \"taggings\", :force => true do |t|\n  t.integer  \"taggable_id\"\n  t.string   \"taggable_type\"\n  t.integer  \"position\"\n  t.integer  \"tag_id\"\n  t.datetime \"created_at\"\n  t.datetime \"updated_at\"\nend\ncreate_table \"tags\", :force => true do |t|\n  t.string   \"name\"\n  t.string   \"context_type\"\n  t.datetime \"created_at\"\n  t.datetime \"updated_at\"\nend\n```\n\nmodels:\n\n```\nclass Recipe < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :taggings, :as => :taggable, :dependent => :destroy\n  has_many :courses, :through => :taggings, :source => :tag, :conditions => {:tags => {:context_type =>  'course'}}\n  scope :ordered_by_course, includes(:courses).where(:taggings => {:position => 0}).order(\"UPPER(tags.name) ASC\").order(\"UPPER(recipes.name) ASC\")\nend\n\nclass Tagging < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :taggable, :polymorphic => true\n  belongs_to :tag\n\n  before_create do\n    self.position = self.taggable.send(self.tag.context_type.to_s.pluralize).count + 1\n  end\nend\n\nclass Tag < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :taggings, :dependent => :destroy\n\n  class << self\n    [\"course\", \"main_ingredient\", \"cuisine\", \"occasion\", \"convenience\", \"cooking_method\"].each do |context|\n      define_method context.pluralize do\n        where(\"tags.context_type = '#{context}'\")\n      end\n    end\n  end\n\nend\n```\n\nCreate some dummy data with IRB:\n\n```\nrecipe = Recipe.create!(:name => \"foo\")\ntag = Tag.create!(:name => \"Main Dish\", :context_type => \"course\")\nrecipe.courses << tag\n```\n\nNow using IRB and do a normal load of the association:\n\n```\nrecipe = Recipe.first\nrecipe.courses # => [#<Tag id: 1, name: \"Main Dish\", context_type: \"course\", created_at: \"2010-11-19 17:04:14\", updated_at: \"2010-11-19 17:04:14\">]\n```\n\nSQL in the log:\n     SELECT \"tags\".\\* FROM \"tags\" INNER JOIN \"taggings\" ON \"tags\".id = \"taggings\".tag_id WHERE ((\"taggings\".taggable_id = 1) AND (\"taggings\".taggable_type = 'Recipe') AND ((\"tags\".\"context_type\" = 'course')))\n\nBack to IRB now lets try the scope:\n    recipes = Recipe.ordered_by_course\n    recipes.first.courses # => []\n\nThat's wrong check the SQL in the log:\n    SELECT \"recipes\".\"id\" AS t0_r0, \"recipes\".\"name\" AS t0_r1,\"tags\".\"id\" AS t1_r0, \"tags\".\"name\" AS t1_r1, \"tags\".\"context_type\" AS t1_r2, \"tags\".\"created_at\" AS t1_r3, \"tags\".\"updated_at\" AS t1_r4 \n    FROM \"recipes\" \n    LEFT OUTER JOIN \"taggings\" ON \"recipes\".\"id\" = \"taggings\".\"taggable_id\" AND \"taggings\".\"taggable_type\" = 'Recipe' \n    LEFT OUTER JOIN \"tags\" ON '\"tags\".\"context_type\" = ''course'' \n    WHERE (recipes.deleted_at IS NULL) AND (\"taggings\".\"position\" = 1) \n    ORDER BY UPPER(tags.name) ASC, UPPER(recipes.name) ASC\n\nWow this is a bit of an issue.\n# The Two Nasty Issues\n## Dirty Nasty Issue 1 - Where did the foreign keys go?\n\nThe first problem is within ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#build_joins and ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#association_join. ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#build_joins is responsible for building the joins for the query (lib/active_record/relation/query_methods.rb:215). Check out this snippet here at line 235-243\n\n```\nto_join = []\njoin_dependency.join_associations.each do |association|\n  if (association_relation = association.relation).is_a?(Array)\n    to_join << [association_relation.first, association.join_type, association.association_join.first]\n    to_join << [association_relation.last, association.join_type, association.association_join.last]\n  else\n    to_join << [association_relation, association.join_type, association.association_join]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nEssentially if the association relation is an array (array of ARel Nodes) we are dealing some type of `has_many :through` relationship. And this snippet assumes that there are only two items in the array (the first should be all the joins for the recipes to taggings and the secound should be for the taggings to tags). \n\nBut now take a look at ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#association_join (in the rails 3-0-stable branch that would be activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb:2135).

But the rest of the function now breaks the assumption that its only going to return that it will return an array of length 2 (lines 2209-2225):\n\n```\n  unless klass.descends_from_active_record?\n    sti_column = aliased_table[klass.inheritance_column]\n    sti_condition = sti_column.eq(klass.sti_name)\n    klass.descendants.each {|subclass| sti_condition = sti_condition.or(sti_column.eq(subclass.sti_name)) }\n\n    @join << sti_condition\n  end\n\n\n  [through_reflection, reflection].each do |ref|\n    if ref && ref.options[:conditions]\n      @join << interpolate_sql(sanitize_sql(ref.options[:conditions], aliased_table_name))\n    end\n  end\n\n  @join\nend\n```\n\nIf the reflection has conditions or if the underlying klass is an STI you now have 3 or more items in your array. In the example I am using we would have three: \n1. the Arel AST nodes for the recipes to taggings table\n2. the Arel AST nodes for the foreign key of taggings to tags\n3. the condition clauses checking the context type of the tag.  \n\nNow look back at  ActiveRecord::QueryMethods#build_joins (lib/active_record/relation/query_methods.rb:235-243).\n\n```\nto_join = []\njoin_dependency.join_associations.each do |association|\n  if (association_relation = association.relation).is_a?(Array)\n    to_join << [association_relation.first, association.join_type, association.association_join.first]\n    to_join << [association_relation.last, association.join_type, association.association_join.last]\n  else\n    to_join << [association_relation, association.join_type, association.association_join]\n  end\nend\n```\n\nYup its totally going to drop the middle condition. So we need to patch ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#association_join to only return an array of length two (since its grouping the joins for each relationship in an array).  I'm just not sure what else this is going to break.\n## Dirty Nasty Issue 2 - What's with the double single quotes?\n\nRecall that the generated SQL had this little snippet `LEFT OUTER JOIN \"tags\" ON '\"tags\".\"context_type\" = ''course''`. Why is it doing this? Well the problem turns out to be ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#association_join again. Re-examine this snippet (activerecord/lib/active_record/associations.rb:218-223)\n\n```\n[through_reflection, reflection].each do |ref|\n  if ref && ref.options[:conditions]\n     @join << interpolate_sql(sanitize_sql(ref.options[:conditions], aliased_table_name))\n  end\nend\n```\n\nThe #sanitize_sql (which is delegated to the active_record) returns a sql string. That is its not passing ARel AST nodes but actual SQL. That might not seem like much of an issue until you realize that ARel will treat this a string value, NOT a sql expression.  We have to look at the ARel code to see what happens (I am using the 2.0.6 gem as reference). Let's look at how ARel's ToSql visitor handles the ON node (lib/arel/visitors/to_sql.rb:190-192):\n\n```\ndef visit_Arel_Nodes_On o\n  \"ON #{visit o.expr}\"\nend\n```\n\nNow remember that ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#association_join set one the condition here to be a string. That means `o.expr # => \"\\\"tags\\\".\\\"content_type\\\" = 'course'\". Well look what happens next (lib/arel/visitors/to_sql.rb:278):\n\n```\ndef visit_String o; quote(o, @last_column) end\n```\n\nIt's going to quote the string as if its a String value to be passed into the database, not the actual sql to be run (lib/arel/visitors/to_sql.rb:294-296)\n\n```\ndef quote value, column = nil\n  @connection.quote value, column\nend\n```\n\nAnd sure enough when we trace this down in activerecord we find (lib/active_record/connection_adapters/abstract/quoting.rb:40-42)\n\n```\ndef quote_string(s)\n  s.gsub(/\\\\/, '\\&\\&').gsub(/'/, \"''\") # ' (for ruby-mode)\nend\n```\n\nWow. At least we know where the issue is. The solution seems to be to patch ActiveRecord::Associations::ClassMethods::JoinDependency::JoinAssociation#association_join so that it does not just give a string, but actual ARel ast nodes. But its going to require some work.\n# Patches\n\nI am currently working on the patches for this issue, but it may take me a while to test. Not to mention that I currently do not have MySQL or PostgreSQL installed on my mac and I've already spent way too much time tracking this down. But I will give it my best shot and hopefully whoever can check as needed. I'll post patches as soon as I have them. I am working off the Rails 3-0-stable branch.\n# Side Note\n\nI checked out 'master' of activerecord, and its gone through a major rewrite. I am not sure if the rewrite addressed this issue, but once I complete my patches for the 3.0 line I can port the tests over to double check\n", "labels": [], "number": 795, "updated_at": "2017-07-25 04:43:55", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:15", "id": 904533, "title": "Rails 3.0.3 Eager Loading associations with additional conditions causes the ON statement to be improperly constructed", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/795", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:25:48", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171050", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **rails** - 2011-03-23 00:00:09 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6273\nCreated by **Paul Schreiber** - 2011-01-10 17:16:44 UTC\n\nNote: I am using Rails 2.3.10. \n\nNormally, you can use Rails‚Äô I18n system to generate label text. \n\nFor example, suppose you have a Person class with a name attribute. And this ERB: \n<%= form_for @person do |f| %> \n<%= f.label :name %> \n<%= f.text_field :name %> \n<% end %> \n\nAnd you‚Äôd construct your en.yml like so: \nen: \n  helpers: \n    label: \n      name: ‚Äúyour name‚Äù \n\nHowever, this doesn‚Äôt work very well with related objects and accepts_nested_attributes_for. Suppose you have the same Person class as before. And person has_many :activities (likewise, activity belongs_to :person) and accepts_nested_attributes_for :activities. \n\nNow your ERB looks like this: \n<%= form_for @person do |f| %> \n<%= f.label :name %> \n<%= f.text_field :name %> \n        <% f.fields_for :activities do |a| %> \n                <%= l.label :difficulty %> \n                <%= l.text_field :difficulty %> \n        <% end %> \n<% end %> \n\nVarious combinations indentation of person / activities / difficulty in my en.yml file didn‚Äôt work. So I looked inside rails to see what‚Äôs going on. \n\nThe relevant code is in actionpack-2.3.10/lib/action_view/helpers/form_helper.rb. The method used is  \n        def to_label_tag(text = nil, options = {}) \non line 758. \n\nAnd the code doing the work is: \n        content = if text.blank? \n          i18n_label = I18n.t(\"helpers.label.#{object_name}.#{method_name}\", :default => ‚Äú‚Äù) \n          i18n_label if i18n_label.present? \n        else \n          text.to_s \n        end \n\nThe problem is you end up with a set of labels like: \n        helpers.label.person[activities_attributes][0].difficulty \n        helpers.label.person[activities_attributes][1].difficulty \n        helpers.label.person[activities_attributes][2].difficulty\n", "labels": [], "number": 805, "updated_at": "2011-07-05 03:42:42", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:17", "id": 904548, "title": "Cannot create I18n labels when using accepts_nested_attributes_for", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/805", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:27:40", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171095", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Alexey Nayden** - 2011-01-23 23:53:35 UTC\n\nThe same problem found in rails 3.0.3\n\nHere're test and patch\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:27:41", "user": 789801, "id": 1171095}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171097", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **rails** - 2011-04-30 00:00:08 UTC\n\nThis issue has been automatically marked as stale because it has not been commented on for at least three months.\n\nThe resources of the Rails core team are limited, and so we are asking for your help.

This leaves the user with an empty test db.\n\nBy adding --single-transaction to the psql command, the contents of the structure sql file gets wrapped in a BEGIN and COMMIT. This will ensure the rake task will commit even if autocommit is disabled. This flag was introduced in 8.2 and is in all the current stable versions. Here is a link to the docs on it: http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/app-psql.html\n\nI have a patch to add the flag but did not add any tests.

My suggestion was to overwrite array of order columns from the current scope with array of order columns from the relation being merged in.\n\nThe Post.popular.recent example makes sense and might be a reason for why none of my suggestions should be used, but then again order is such a simple operation that it's easy to list all the columns you need in one place. Usually I'd just be confused that my last call to order wasn't the one used rather than happy that I was was able to merge two named order scopes. Take this test from rails tests (tests/cases/relations_test.rb):\n\n```\ndef test_order_using_scoping\n  car1 = CoolCar.order('id DESC').scoping do\n    CoolCar.find(:first, :order => 'id asc')\n  end\n  assert_equal 'zyke', car1.name\n\n  car2 = FastCar.order('id DESC').scoping do\n    FastCar.find(:first, :order => 'id asc')\n  end\n  assert_equal 'zyke', car2.name\nend\n```\n\nTo me it reads \"def test_we_have_a_bug\".

I think that there is no reason (point me if i'm wrong) to allow user to use except only inside lambdas. I understand that I need to use lambda when I use Time.now or something but here I need some additional knowledge about how except, order, where and etc works inside rails. I don't think that it is good. I've added to my patch test with scope with lambda like:\n\n```\nlambda { except(:order).order(\"name DESC\") }\n```\n\nand test passes. \n\nHow it works and why I think we can calculate except at evaluation time.

This seems to be a bug, and has broken many of our own custom helpers without providing any additional safety.\n\nI overrode Array.join to return safe strings (SafeBuffers) when all the elements of the array are safe, and the separator is either not specified or html_safe itself.  This is consistent with Ruby's behavior when joining arrays of untainted objects with an untainted separator.\n\nAdditionally, I overrode html_safe? on Array to return true if every element is safe.  This will allow Array.join to operate properly in the recursive case (joining an Array of arrays).\n", "labels": [], "number": 812, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:17", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:17", "id": 904558, "title": "[PATCH] Array.join making safe strings unsafe", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/812", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:28:48", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171126", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Derek Croft** - 2011-01-18 13:17:02 UTC\n\n+1\n\nUpgrading to Rails 3.0.3 causes all Array.join calls to escape for me.

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6392\nCreated by **Nick M** - 2011-02-09 05:26:58 UTC\n### Problem\n\nActiveResource doesn't currently support file objects within an instance. If you try and save an ActiveResource instance that contains a file attachment, the file object's attributes get serialized, but not the file itself. For example, this is what ActiveResource currently sends when trying to create a new object that contains an uploaded file:\n\n``` xml\n    <user>\n      <first-name>Tom</first-name>\n      <last-name>Jones</last-name>\n      <address>1234 Test Rd</address>\n      <avatar type=\"yaml\">--- !ruby/object:ActionDispatch::Http::UploadedFile \n    content_type: image/png\n    headers: |\n      Content-Disposition: form-data; name=\"user[avatar]\"; filename=\"Picture 4.png\"\n      Content-Type: image/png\n\n    original_filename: Picture 4.png\n    tempfile: !ruby/object:File {}\n    </avatar>\n    </user>\n```\n\nThat serialized `<avatar>` content obviously won't work on the remote server since it doesn't actually contain the file data. You can try to base64 encode your file content inside the XML or JSON data being sent to the remote server, but that is cumbersome, slow, and requires individual changes to both your client and server code.\n### Patch\n\nI've attached a patch with tests (for both master and the 3-0-stable branch) that gives you the option to send and encode your ActiveResource POST and PUT request data as `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or, when file attachments are present, `multipart/form-data`. Since Net::HTTP doesn't natively handle mutlipart attachments, I introduced a dependency on the `Payload` class from [rest-client](http://rubygems.org/gems/rest-client).\n\nTo enable this new encoding option, I added a new class attribute, `ActiveRecord::Base.payload_encoding`. It works similar to how the `format` option works (it can be set globally or on a per-class basis). `payload_encoding` defaults to `:serialized` for compatibility (data will continue to be posted as serialized JSON or XML). Or `payload_encoding` can be set to `:form` to encode the attributes as form elements/multipart data for attachments.\n\nThis feature also seems handy to have for remote web services that expect data encoded this way (and not as JSON or XML).\n\nFinally, regarding compatibility, it's disabled by default so it shouldn't interfere, but if you're targeting a Rails-based backend service, I believe enabling it should be mostly seamless. Since a Rails backend will automatically decode the XML and JSON data sent to into form parameters anyway, this simply negates the need for that step.\n### Example\n\n``` ruby\n    class Image < ActiveResource::Base\n      self.site = \"http://localhost:3001/\"\n      self.format = :json\n      self.payload_encoding = :form\n    end\n```\n\n`Image.find` and others will continue to fetch the data using JSON. However, `Image.create` and other save methods will post the data as form attributes, allowing multipart attachments to also work.\n", "labels": [], "number": 831, "updated_at": "2015-01-06 14:19:21", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:20", "id": 904581, "title": "[patch] ActiveResource doesn't support file uploads/attachments", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/831", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:31:45", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171188", "text": "Attachments saved to Gist: http://gist.github.com/971771\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:31:45", "user": 789801, "id": 1171188}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/3302577", "text": "Any reason this was closed without merging?\n", "created_at": "2011-12-29 17:02:54", "user": 305470, "id": 3302577}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4346101", "text": "I'm also curious if this will ever come to fruition.\n", "created_at": "2012-03-06 15:21:53", "user": 110935, "id": 4346101}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/4481204", "text": "+1 for a way to do this\n", "created_at": "2012-03-13 18:25:01", "user": 310707, "id": 4481204}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/52764053", "text": "So, um, no further discussion here?\n", "created_at": "2014-08-20 11:40:04", "user": 89889, "id": 52764053}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/58739076", "text": "+1 would be nice to have it, any idea why this was closed ?\n", "created_at": "2014-10-11 05:40:25", "user": 238278, "id": 58739076}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/68869270", "text": "+1\n", "created_at": "2015-01-06 14:11:11", "user": 4987386, "id": 68869270}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/68870197", "text": "Active resource was extracted from rails\n", "created_at": "2015-01-06 14:19:21", "user": 47848, "id": 68870197}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

{"reactions": {}, "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._ Original ticket at: http://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/6406\nCreated by **Christopher Thompson** - 2011-02-10 18:05:01 UTC\n\nThis problem exists in Rails 2.3.10. Code inspection in 3-0-stable shows the problem also exists there, but I have not verified this. Below, I am discussing Rails 2.3.10.\n\nActiveRecord::XmlSerializer#add_associations does not properly deal with :has_one relationships. It fails to add the type of the associated data. Worse, if the container object uses STI, the :has_one associated data will claim to be the type of the container object.\n\nConsider for example:\n\n```\nclass Container < ActiveRecord::Base\n  has_many :sti_outer_objs\n\n  def dump\n    to_xml({:include=>{:sti_outer_objs=>{:include=>{:sti_inner_obj=>{}}}}})\n  end\nend\n\nclass StiOuterObj < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :container\n  has_one :sti_inner_obj\nend\n\nclass StiOuterDerivedObj < StiOuterObj\nend\n\nclass StiInnerObj < ActiveRecord::Base\n  belongs_to :sti_outer_obj\nend\n\nclass StiInnerDerivedObj < StiInnerObj\nend\n```\n\nNow, use the following hierarchy:\n\n```\ncontainer -> [sti_outer_derived] -> sti_inner_derived\n```\n\nCalling container.dump will show that the generated XML claims that sti_inner_derived's type is \"StiOuterDerived\".\n\nThe fix is simple and straightforward; we have to calculate the type of the :has_one data. Attached is a patch against Rails-2.3.10 which accomplishes this and solves the problem.\n\nThe patch does not apply against Rails 3.x, but I believe the modification is trivial.\n\nI am happy to provide any additional information required.\n", "labels": [], "number": 838, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:21", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:21", "id": 904590, "title": "ActiveRecord::XmlSerializer fails with has_one types", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/838", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:32:29", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171195", "text": "Attachments saved to Gist: http://gist.github.com/971774\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:32:29", "user": 789801, "id": 1171195}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

The default in most cases should now be to escape the text by calling html_safe in the helper.  Let people call html_safe before calling the helper if they want to avoid escaping.  \n\nThese are the helpers that have either an `escape` parameter or `:escape` option that we can deprecate:\n- `FormTagHelper#text_area_tag`. Remove the :escape option. Santiago suggested removing this one.  \n- `TagHelper#content_tag`. Remove the escape param, which currently doesn't work. See below for details.\n- `TagHelper#tag`. Remove escape param, which currently defaults to true. \n\nSantiago asked me to go ahead and make a patch for this deprecation, which I will do.  \n\n---\n\nHere's why I said the escape param for `content_tag` currently doesn't work:\n\nIn a 3.0.1 Rails project the output is never escaped but html_safe? always returns true:\n\n``` ruby\n  rails console\n  Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.1)\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :001 > helper.content_tag :div do '<b>hello</b>' end\n  => \"<div><b>hello</b></div>\"\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :002 > (helper.content_tag :div do '<b>hello</b>' end).html_safe?\n   => true\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :003 > helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,true do '<b>hello</b>' end\n   => \"<div><b>hello</b></div>\"\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :004 > (helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,true do '<b>hello</b>' end).html_safe?\n   => true\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :005 > helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,false do '<b>hello</b>' end\n   => \"<div><b>hello</b></div>\"\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :006 > (helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,false do '<b>hello</b>' end).html_safe?\n   => true\n```\n\nIn a Rails 3.0.2 project the content is always escaped and html_safe? always returns true:\n\n``` ruby\n  rails console\n  Loading development environment (Rails 3.0.2)\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :001 > helper.content_tag :div do '<b>hello</b>' end\n   => \"<div>&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;</div>\"\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :002 > (helper.content_tag :div do '<b>hello</b>' end).html_safe?\n   => true\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :003 > helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,true do '<b>hello</b>' end\n   => \"<div>&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;</div>\"\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :004 > (helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,true do '<b>hello</b>' end).html_safe?\n   => true\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :005 > helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,false do '<b>hello</b>' end\n   => \"<div>&lt;b&gt;hello&lt;/b&gt;</div>\"\n  ruby-1.8.7-p330 :006 > (helper.content_tag :div,nil,nil,false do '<b>hello</b>' end).html_safe?\n   => true\n```\n\nSo at least in Rails 3.0.2 the html_safe? function is reporting the truth. But content_tag escapes the output even when escape=false (see the last two lines). \n\n[This is the commit that changed the behavior](https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/bb9c58eb4aa637fa75c69c705a9918d6322ff834). After this change, escape=true doesn't work but calling html_safe still does.\n", "labels": [], "number": 845, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:22", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:22", "id": 904600, "title": "Deprecate 'escape' parameter/option in three helper functions", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/845", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:33:23", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171211", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Brian Morearty** - 2011-02-13 00:37:26 UTC\n\nI'm writing a patch with deprecation notices for 3-0-stable.

The 3 helper functions mentioned above (`FormTagHelper#text_area_tag`, `TagHelper#content_tag`, and `TagHelper#tag` ) will have the following behavior after these patches are applied:\n- In 3.0.5, using the 'escape' parameter or option will show a deprecation message.\n- In 3.1 the 'escape' parameter or option to these 3 methods is removed.  The correct way to specify escaping behavior is to call (or not call) `html_safe` on the parameters.

I'll change it to something better, like a string with an HTML tag in it.\n\n```\n-                final_value = value.is_a?(Array) ? value.join(\" \") : value\n-                final_value = ERB::Util.html_escape(final_value) if escape\n+                final_value = value.is_a?(Array) ? value.map{|v|ERB::Util.html_escape(v)}.join(\" \") : ERB::Util.html_escape(value)\n```\n\nAt first I did it the way you suggested--just leave the old code in place but always call html_escape. It caused problems because (I think) joining an array of strings, some of which are unsafe, results in a string that's unsafe. Then we escape it so all the content from all the array elements gets escaped. \n\nSo if there's an array and you want one of the elements to be considered safe you have to mark them all safe. If I remember correctly. This approach was a fix for that problem.\n\n```\n-              unless options[:sanitize] == false\n+              if options.fetch(:sanitize, true)\n                 link_text = sanitize(link_text)\n                 href      = sanitize(href)\n+              else\n+                link_text = link_text.html_safe\n+                href      = href.html_safe\n               end\n-              content_tag(:a, link_text, link_attributes.merge('href' => href), !!options[:sanitize]) + punctuation.reverse.join('')\n+              content_tag(:a, link_text, link_attributes.merge('href' => href)) + punctuation.reverse.join('')\n```\n\nYeah, this is a tricky case. I knew that sanitize != escape but the old code was passing !!options[:sanitize] to content_tag's \"escape\" parameter, so the effect was:\n1. If sanitize was true we also escaped it after sanitizing. Now the sanitize function calls html_safe at the end (not as part of my change), so this old behavior is probably broken.\n2. If sanitize was false we didn't escape it. My call to html_safe in the 'else' clause keeps this behavior. But I think you're right, I shouldn't call html_safe here. I should let the content be output as an unsafe string.\n\nI'll revisit this code and let you know what I find.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:33:36", "user": 789801, "id": 1171218}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171219", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Brian Morearty** - 2011-02-18 17:25:08 UTC\n\nHi Santiago,\n\nThanks again for the help! Here is a new patch for the master branch. This is what I did:\n\nRe: your first point, you are right--the example wasn't good. I have fixed the `tag` example to something that makes more sense.

Joining a mix of html-safe and unsafe strings results in a single unsafe string, and escaping that would result in escaping some parts that were already safe. This irb session illustrates the difference:\n\n``` ruby\n# This is what my change does\nruby-1.8.7-p330 :011 > [ERB::Util.html_escape('a<b'),ERB::Util.html_escape('b<c'.html_safe)].join(\" \")\n => \"a&lt;b b<c\" \n# This is what your proposed change does--it escapes b<c even though it's safe\nruby-1.8.7-p330 :012 > ERB::Util.html_escape(['a<b','b<c'.html_safe].join(\" \"))\n => \"a&lt;b b&lt;c\" \n```\n\nRe: your third point, I now remember why I added the html_safe calls. I tried reverting them them but the pre-existing `test_auto_link_should_not_sanitize_input_when_sanitize_option_is_false` test failed because all the ampersands are turned into ampersand-amp;. The `auto_link` helper has never escaped ampersands. This makes sense because when you use auto_link the input is an HTML string already, so any escaping that the caller wants is up to them. You said \"we should avoid marking html_safe unsafe content\" but the regex that recognizes a URL stops when it reaches a less-than or greater-than character, so the URL is always safe. My addition of html_safe is required to keep the behavior consistent because the `escape` parameter was removed from the content_tag call on the next line (since it's no longer supported).\n\nIn a side note, it turns out the `sanitize` parameter to `auto_link` is most likely irrelevant because the regexes used for both email and url recognition stop when they reach the first angle bracket. So there will never be anything to sanitize in a url or email. But that's a discussion for another day.\n\nSo to sum it up, in the end the only change from the first patch was the example for `tag`.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:33:38", "user": 789801, "id": 1171219}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171220", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Brian Morearty** - 2011-02-23 21:07:20 UTC\n\nHi,\n\nI was wondering if there's anything I can do to help push this along.

This ticked is enhanced version of this one https://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/1207-postgresqladapter-postgres-error-while-finding-when-using-a-function-with-two-parameters-in-order-clause\n\nThe problem is that PostgreSQL requires the ORDER BY columns in the select list for distinct queries, and also requires that the ORDER BY include the distinct column. All works pretty well if you just have plain parameters in ORDER BY clause. For example, something like \n\n``` sql\nORDER BY \"pcs\".min_cost DESC, \"pcs\".title\n```\n\nwill be parsed well and added to DISTINCT PART as\n\n``` sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ..., \"pcs\".min_cost AS alias_0, \"pcs\".title AS alias_1\n```\n\nBut if you will use something complex in ORDER BY string ‚Äì all will be bad! The problem is that now distinct() method of PostgreSQL adapter simple splits ORDER BY string by ','.\n\nFor example:\n\n``` sql\nORDER BY COALESCE(\"pcs\".min_cost, \"pcs\".max_cost) DESC\n```\n\nwill be parsed, splitted and transformed into incorrect DISTINCT clause:\n\n``` sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ON (\"pcs\".id) \"pcs\".id, COALESCE(pcs.min_cost AS alias_0, pcs.max_cost) AS alias_1 FROM \"pcs\"\n```\n\nThis query won't be executed because of syntax errors. I created patch that allows to use Array as :order param in find() method. \nSee\n**:order => [\"COALESCE(pcs.min_cost, pcs.max_cost) DESC\"]**\nwill be translated into \n\n``` sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ON (\"pcs\".id) \"pcs\".id, COALESCE(pcs.min_cost, pcs.max_cost) AS alias_0\n```\n\nand \n**:order => [\"COALESCE(pcs.min_cost, pcs.max_cost) DESC\", \"pcs.title\"]**\nwill be\n\n``` sql\nSELECT DISTINCT ON (\"pcs\".id) \"pcs\".id, COALESCE(pcs.min_cost, pcs.max_cost) AS alias_0, pcs.title AS alias_1\n```\n\nAll works good, and Array syntax is easy to understand. All test run well. This affects 2.3 and 3.0 branches.\n\nThanks.

However, it only seems to become an ActiveRecord issue if there is a join involved. For example\n\n```\nArticle.count\n=> 10 # Correct\n\nArticle.limit(3).count\n=> 3  # Also correct.\n```\n\nThe SQL generated by this statement is:\n\n```\nSELECT COUNT(*) AS count_id FROM (SELECT 1 FROM `categories` LIMIT 3) AS subquery\n```\n\nSo Rails is already using the sub-query technique for simpler relationships.\n\nThe LIMIT clause acts to limit the number of lines being output. As a simple count only has one output line, LIMIT appears to have no effect.

This was the best I could do (correct me if I'm wrong):\n\nAt first, sessions were created on each request but it was harming performance so they decided to lazy it and then ActionController::Session::AbstractStore::SessionHash was created. It extends the normal Hash class but it's extended with some methods including 'destroy' which is responsible for the error I am receiving.\n\nFor a reason I don't know, when a request is created or reseted, it's content is an empty normal Hash. It's only changed to a SessionHash farther when the method call is called from an AbstractStore instance.\nI don't know why the creation still sets a normal hash to the session variable and not a SessionHash however I made a 'patch' without breaking tests and without changing this behavior.\n\n```\n./actionpack/lib/action_controller/session/abstract_store.rb (original):\n\n  def session\n    @env['rack.session'] ||= {}\n  end\n\n  def reset_session\n    session.destroy if session\n    self.session = {}\n  end\n```\n\n```\n./actionpack/lib/action_controller/session/abstract_store.rb (patch?):\n\n  def session\n    @env['rack.session'] ||= {}\n  end\n\n  def reset_session\n    session.destroy if session && session.is_a?(ActionController::Session::AbstractStore::SessionHash)\n    self.session = {}\n  end\n```\n\nHope it helps, and please correct me when I'm wrong.\n", "labels": [], "number": 852, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:24", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:24", "id": 904610, "title": "Session Reset undefined method `destroy' for {}:Hash", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/852", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:34:48", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171244", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Rob Di Marco** - 2011-03-01 04:04:47 UTC\n\nI submitted a pull request that includes a unit test that illustrates the problem and a patch to fix the destroy method at https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/198\n\nWhile this is waiting to be fixed in the main tree, I have monkey patched the reset_session method like so\n\n```\n# file config/initializers/rails_6440_patch.rb\nActionController::Request.class_eval do\n    def reset_session\n      # session may be a hash, if so, we do not want to call destroy\n      # fixes issue 6440\n      session.destroy if session and session.respond_to?(:destroy)\n      self.session = {}\n    end\nend\n```\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:34:49", "user": 789801, "id": 1171244}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171245", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **tiegz** - 2011-04-01 17:41:27 UTC\n\nHaving the same issue, +1! \n\nRelated, it looks like you might have seen this similar issue in master and augmented your solution to match?\n\nhttps://rails.lighthouseapp.com/projects/8994/tickets/5634-reset_session-in-action_dispatchhttprequestrb-failing-in-test-mode\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:34:50", "user": 789801, "id": 1171245}], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

But, when you have a Hash object as the result of a REST call, it breaks the GEM, because 'collect!' is not a valid method for the Hash class.\n\nSee this:\n        def instantiate_collection(collection, prefix_options = {})\n          collection.collect! { |record| instantiate_record(record, prefix_options) }    #This is the problem line.\n        end\n\nCan someone please fix this?\nThanks,\n", "labels": [], "number": 854, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:25", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:25", "id": 904613, "title": "ActiveResource::Base class is defective", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/854", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:35:05", "comments": [], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

Instead, erroneous SQL is emitted and allowed to corrupt the database by updating random records.\n\nAR shouldn't try to protect programmers from every possible manifestation of their own folly. However, in this case, Arel is actually partially responsible for _creating_ the problem: it turns an invalid request into a valid-but-inaccurate SQL statement.

I've found that basically every web project I've ever worked on has needed functionality to strip and clean form inputs, e.g. stripping non-numeric characters from a credit card number field.\n\nSo I'd like to implement something similar to ActiveModel's validations, except that it would happen before the validation stage.  The API is completely open at this point; I was thinking something like this:\n\n``` ruby\nclass CreditCard\n\n  # attributes: number, name\n  transform :number do |num|\n    num.gsub(/\\D/, '')\n  end\n  transform :name do |num|\n    num.strip\n  end\nend\n\ncc = CreditCard.new(:number => '4111-1111-1111-1111', :name => ' Mike Perham ')\ncc.save!\n[cc.number, cc.name] # => ['4111111111111111', 'Mike Perham']\n```\n\nbut I'm happy to discuss use cases and what the API might look like at this point.

The first thing that comes to my mind was that these transformers should easily be chainable e.g. like rack-middleware. Output of the first transformer could be treated as input to the next transformer. Furthermore I think it¬¥s important to implement the API in a way that custom transformers can easily be added. \n\nWhat do you think about this: \n\n<pre>\nvalidates :name, :presence => true, :transformer => [:remove_whitespace, :remove_invalid_chars]\n</pre>\n\n\nThis way the entire chain of transformers is grouped with the validator and easily verifyable.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:37:28", "user": 789801, "id": 1171272}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171273", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **thoefer** - 2011-02-27 15:34:20 UTC\n\nAnd I think it¬¥s important to really distinguish between what¬¥s is implemented as a transformer (and therefore before the validation stage) and what should be a validator.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:37:29", "user": 789801, "id": 1171273}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171274", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Josep M.

There's some stuff pending (inheriting transformations for example).\n\nSomehow I like better the idea of having validations and transformations as two separate sets of callbacks, since they are inherently different concepts. I've mirrored the structure of ActiveModel::Validations, creating a new type of :transform callbacks and all.\n\nThe only thing I don't like with this approach is that transformers are not chainasble, and, as @thoefer says, intuitively it would be a nice feature to have.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:37:31", "user": 789801, "id": 1171274}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171276", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Trevor Turk** - 2011-02-27 23:21:31 UTC\n\nWhy not just override the setter method?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:37:32", "user": 789801, "id": 1171276}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171277", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **thoefer** - 2011-02-28 18:52:35 UTC\n\nYou convinced me Josep. I think it¬¥s better to separate validations and transformations. I think the possibility to chain transformers is almost a must-have. Therefore I tried to implement the basic library in this way, as you can see in https://gist.github.com/847786 (please scroll down for the actual AR-model and transformer usage). \n\nIt basically looks like this:\n\n<pre>\nclass Asset < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n  include ActiveModel::Transformers\n\n  # Usage examples for chainable transformer API. UseCases: \n  # - builtin transformer without customized options \n  # - builtin transformer with customized options \n  # - custom transformer (as a lambda)\n\n  # API for builtin transformers relying on default-options\n  transform :age, :digit, :strip\n\n  # API for builtin transformer with customized options and a custom transformer\n  transform :name do\n    with :strip, :l => false\n    with lambda {|value| \"custom transformer: ...#{value}...\"}\n  end\n  \nend\n</pre>\n\n\n@Trevor: You¬¥re absolutely right with your proposal. Nontheless it would be helpful to have a couple of basic transformers available for filtering. \n\nComments?\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:37:34", "user": 789801, "id": 1171277}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171278", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **thoefer** - 2011-02-28 18:56:50 UTC\n\nforgot to mention, sorry: output of one transformer is treated as input value for the next one.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:37:35", "user": 789801, "id": 1171278}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171279", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Mike Perham** - 2011-02-28 19:09:49 UTC\n\nAfter weekend consideration, I'm now wondering if this shouldn't just be a before_validation and after_validation block for each model.

However, when doing a `Channel.arel_engine.connection.instance_eval {@config[:database]}`, I get the standard ActiveRecord database connection returned. It appears as if Arel does not pick up on the modified `active_record` connection. The funny thing is that this only appears for some of my models. Others return the correct database for both connection and arel_engine. \n\nAnother thing to notice is that while `Channel.first` works fine, I get the following error, when doing a `Channel.find(1)`:\n\n```\nNoMethodError: undefined method `eq' for nil:NilClass\n```\n\nRegards,\n\nSebastian\n", "labels": [], "number": 880, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:28", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:28", "id": 904650, "title": "Arel not picking up on ActiveRecord establish_connection settings", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/880", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:39:34", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171293", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Sebastian Vogelsang** - 2011-03-01 18:21:38 UTC\n\nok, I got it working by changing my code to the following:\n\n```\nmodels.each do |klass|\n  next unless klass < ActiveRecord::Base\n  klass.establish_connection \"processing_#{Rails.env}\"\n  klass.class_eval do\n    @arel_engine = klass\n    @arel_table = Arel::Table.new(klass.table_name, klass)\n    @relation = ActiveRecord::Relation.new(klass, @arel_table)\n  end\nend\n```\n\nI hope this is not the way we have to do it from now?!?

I'd expect that attr_writeonce allows to change the attribute from nil to a value (exactly once). It's similar to attr_readonly but it works for persisted records. Do you think it's useful?

It also doesn't rely on `#size` (which not all Enuemrables respond to).\n\nThe patch also improves the robustness of the tests. `#each_with_object` is also optimized by not capturing the block.\n\nProblems not addressed:\n- most extensions assume that the Enumerable yields only one argument.\n- the definition of `#many?` can be confusing because the form without block doesn't test for truthiness. Thus `foo.many?` is not necessarily equal to `foo.many?{|x| x}`, and `foo.any?` can be false while foo.many? can be true (e.g. `foo = [nil, nil]`).

Whereas SQLite3 is handled before the rescue clause so even when it successfully creates the database it still drops into the else clause on the last line of the create_databases method which prints database already exists. My suggested fix would be to put an unless on the puts:\n\n``` ruby\n    else\n      $stderr.puts \"#{config['database']} already exists\" unless config['adapter'] =~ /sqlite/\n    end\n```\n\nI'm on a Mac running Ruby 1.9.2p0.\n", "labels": [], "number": 899, "updated_at": "2011-07-24 16:22:15", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:30", "id": 904678, "title": "SQLite3 incorrectly reports database already exists on db:create ", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/899", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:41:55", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171330", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Todd Huss** - 2011-03-04 19:09:26 UTC\n\nI should add that this issue is specific to all versions of Ruby 1.9.2 that I tested (including the latest 1.9.2p136).

I'm just hobby rails programer so by Rails debugging scrills are limited, but it looks like Rails is not using SCRIPT_NAME, but instead is using \"config.relative_url_root\" in Application Controller's.\n\nI try to make a sense out of the rails source greb'ing after string SCRIPT_NAME, but I just come up with actionpack/lib/action_controller/metal/compatibility.rb  that has:\n\n---\n\n```\n  # ROUTES TODO: This should be handled by a middleware and route generation\n  # should be able to handle SCRIPT_NAME\n  self.config.relative_url_root = ENV['RAILS_RELATIVE_URL_ROOT']\n```\n\n---\n\nWell....

After analyzing my logs I noticed that chaining named scopes actually executes extra unscoped queries along the way. Which is a big deal, especially if they are loading thousands of records.\n\nThe fix is actually very easy, but it involved removing code, and I have no idea what the purpose of the code is. Take the original method:\n\n  def named_scope(name, options = {}, &block)\n    name = name.to_sym\n\n```\nscopes[name] = lambda do |parent_scope, *args|\n  Scope.new(parent_scope, case options\n    when Hash\n      options\n    when Proc\n      if self.model_name != parent_scope.model_name\n        options.bind(parent_scope).call(*args)\n      else\n        options.call(*args)\n      end\n  end, &block)\nend\n\nsingleton_class.send :define_method, name do |*args|\n  scopes[name].call(self, *args)\nend\n```\n\n  end\n\nNotice this line:\n\n  if self.model_name != parent_scope.model_name\n\nThe \"parent_scope.model_name\" actually executes a query, because parent scope can be a proxy that delegates its method calls off to the query result. So doing something like:\n\n  user = User.first\n  user.orders.state_equals(\"pending\").total_greater_than(100).count\n\nThe last line should execute a single \"count\" query. Instead, because of line mentioned above, it actually executes a \"select all\" for the users orders with state \"pending\". Then it executes the count query.\n\nThe fix ix very easy. Change this:\n\n  if self.model_name != parent_scope.model_name\n    options.bind(parent_scope).call(_args)\n  else\n    options.call(_args)\n  end\n\nTo this:\n\n  if self.model_name != parent_scope.model_name\n    options.bind(parent_scope).call(_args)\n  else\n    options.call(_args)\n  end\n\nAgain, I have no idea what the line in question does. Hence the reason I didn't create a pull request on github.\n", "labels": [], "number": 911, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:31", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:31", "id": 904697, "title": "Chaining named scopes executes an unnecessary query.", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/911", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:43:19", "comments": [], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

However, I do not think of the view and controller as being the exact same context (though they share instance vars), so it did not occur to me that I am not allowed to 'def message' inside a mailer.\n\nSteps to reproduce:\n1. create a new mailer\n2. define two delivery methods, call one of them 'message'. Make it accept an argument or three for extra confusion.\n3. Try to send an email with the method that isn't called 'message'.\n4. Read the exception.\n\nGist of my mailer:\nhttps://gist.github.com/871136\n\nGist of exception from my rspec test:\nhttps://gist.github.com/871143\n\nThanks a lot!\n", "labels": [], "number": 933, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:33", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:33", "id": 904731, "title": "ActionMailer::Base has an undocumented public attribute, leading to confusion", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/933", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:46:26", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171411", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **ifesdjeen** - 2011-03-19 10:44:44 UTC\n\nIt's not a direct part of ActionMailer::Base.

We are also running Rails 2.3.9 and might be unfamiliar with new functionality available in 3.x*\n\n---\n\nWe have recently scaled our app horizontally using the 'shared nothing' architecture approach, and now that we have multiple servers (and background processes) acting concurrently on the Database we are tracing several ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid exceptions related to deadlock or other constraint violations that are transient and thus retryable.\n\nThe MySQL team believes deadlocks are transient, frequent and inherently safe in transactional databases - and that consuming applications should be _'always prepared to re-issue a transaction'_; see http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-deadlocks.html\n\n> ### 13.2.8.9.¬†How to Cope with Deadlocks\n> \n> Deadlocks are a classic problem in transactional databases, but they are not \n> dangerous unless they are so frequent that you cannot run certain \n> transactions at all. Normally, you must write your applications so that they are \n> always prepared to re-issue a transaction if it gets rolled back because of a deadlock.\n> \n> **InnoDB** uses automatic row-level locking. You can get deadlocks even in the \n> case of transactions that just insert or delete a single row. That is because \n> these operations are not really ‚Äúatomic‚Äù; they automatically set locks on the \n> (possibly several) index records of the row inserted or deleted.\n\n---\n#### My Team has been looking into this for several weeks now and have made the following observations:\n1. Why not use `SHOW ENGINE INNODB STATUS` to identify and remediate deadlocks? While a useful tool, we believe this approach represents an anti-pattern:\n   - because MySQL states as policy that deadlocks are a common occurrence that should be retried as opposed to eliminated\n   - because MySQL states even single statement transactions `INSERT INTO‚Ä¶` will produce deadlocks and are thus at some level deadlocks are unable to be eliminated (reproduced often in our system)\n   - because anticipating deadlocks is an impossible task, and relying on deadlock reports in order to resolve them means that we are creating a poor user experience while we wait for data to respond to\n   - because pessimistic locking to ensure data integrity in situations like 'counters' is expensive and creates more frequent deadlocks\n   - because modifying extensive blocks of execution (theoretically all controller actions) to avoid deadlocks is hardly concise; nor within the ability of many junior members of the community\n2. Why not extend the `ActiveRecord::Base.transaction` method to include automatic retry mechanisms? While this could theoretically solve the problem, we believe this approach also represents an anti-pattern:\n   - because the definition of `transaction` is inherently different in Rails and the Database layer. In the database, a single statement under auto-commit represents a transaction; in Rails a transaction typically represents multiple statements that form an atomic process. In order to use transaction auto-retry, every statement would have to be wrapped in a transaction block - which is hardly readable - or DRY. _caveat: perhaps Rails could wrap single statements in a transparent retry block that the programmer wouldn't see; but I don't know how to go about doing this_\n   - because multi-statement transactions in Rails operate within a lexical scope (typically controller) instance and local variables may be modified during multi-statement blocks; automatic retry of the block would likely fail due to unintended behavior caused by programmers' expectation that statements would only be executed once‚Ä¶ _caveat: perhaps it would be possible to create a binding closure of all variables in scope before performing the transaction block, and to restore this closure before re-trying; however this approach seems to me to very inefficient - and I do not understand Ruby to the degree necessary to implement this_\n   - because IMHO, there are transient database errors caused by concurrency other than deadlocks which I believe should be gracefully retried, and which are not necessarily encapsulated in a single SQL Statement:\n#### Example constraint violation\n\n```\nclass CreateUsers < ActiveRecord::Migration\n  def self.up\n    create_table :users, :options => 'ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8' do |t|\n      ‚Ä¶\n      t.string :email, :null => false, :limit => 255\n      ‚Ä¶\n    end\n    add_index :users, :email, :unique => true, :name => 'index_users_unique'\n  end\nend\n\n```\n\n---\n\n```\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n‚Ä¶\nvalidates_uniqueness_of :email, :allow_blank => true\n‚Ä¶\nend\n\n```\n\n---\n\n```\n### I am using two statements here which effectively implement find_or_create_by to illustrate how multi-statement scenarios exist which should be retried.\nProcess #1: User.create(:email => 'somebody@some.host.com') unless User.find_by_email('somebody@some.host.com') \nProcess #2: User.create(:email => 'somebody@some.host.com') unless User.find_by_email('somebody@some.host.com') \n```\n\nHere, we've implemented a unique index on the email column for the users table to guarantee data integrity under concurrent conditions, matched with an 'optimistic' validation in the model. In this scenario neither process finds a user matching the email attribute and thus attempts a create. The create then executes the validates_uniqueness_of validation in both processes, which succeed. The `INSERT INTO USER` statements are then sent to the database which responds with a duplicate key violation.\n### What we have done\n\nBased on our observations, we believe that wholesale retry of requests instead of transactions is the preferred approach. We believe proper controller actions should be implemented to never leave data in an inconsistent state, thus it should be safe to retry any action in its entirety.\n\nDue to our limited knowledge of the Rails core, we have implemented a rescue_from ActiveRecord::StatementInvalid at the ApplicationController base point, and respond with Javascript embedded in a blank HTML document which resubmits the request using the same method as the original attempt.\n\n**We know this is a hack. We know this hack increases network traffic and only works for HTML requests from browsers supporting JS; any actions which respond to any other formats are still hosed.**\n\nWe originally attempted to use the rescue_from to interrupt the exception event and re-envoke the controller action; however, this led to duplicate render errors and a myriad of other problems because instance variables had been set/changed in the controller object. \n\nWe also tried to use a background NetHTTP process to attempt a second request that the user wouldn't experience‚Ä¶ however this approach failed to supply the request context; i.e. the users session and cookies weren't available - much less the request headers.\n\nWhat approach can you Rails geniuses come up with?\n", "labels": [], "number": 942, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:33", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:33", "id": 904745, "title": "What are 'best practices' for dealing with transient database errors (like Deadlocks and constraint violations) in a highly concurrent Rails system?", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/942", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:47:31", "comments": [], "assignees": [], "state": "closed", "is-pull-request": false}

The problem is that there is no way for us to tell the difference between someone referencing a column and string literal without a full blown SQL parser.  The problem stems from the fact that we allow users to add arbitrary snippets of SQL.  Arbitrary snippets of SQL, in addition to reconciling eager loaded tables within those snippets makes everything fail.\n\nWe can't tell if someone is referencing a \"table like thing\" from a string literal because string literal quoting changes from database to database.

Here's a mini example of the sort of error I had:\n\n``` ruby\nclass User < ActiveRecord::Base\n\n  before_create :foo\n\n  def foo\n    if self.age > 30\n      self.completed_survey = self.prequalified\n    else\n      self.completed_survey = true\n    end\n  end\n\nend\n\n# this one saves\nuser = User.create(:age => 15, :prequalified => false)\n# this one also saves\nuser = User.create(:age => 35, :prequalified => true)\n# this one does not save!\nuser = User.create(:age => 35, :prequalified => false)\n```\n\nCan you spot the error? The title of the bug gives it away. If the user is over 30 and prequalified is false, foo will accidentally return false and returning false from a before_create callback cancels the save. Also, using User.create instead of User.create! meant no exception was raised, so it went unnoticed for awhile.\n\nThis ticket is a proposal to change the interface so that save cancellation is explicit rather than implicit. Something like self.abort_save! could raise a cancel exception. The old interface could be slowly deprecated by warning when false is returned.\n\nIf this code was written, would it be accepted?\n", "labels": [], "number": 956, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:35", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:35", "id": 904766, "title": "explicit callback cancellation instead of implicit based on return value", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/956", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:49:07", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171442", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Andrew White** - 2011-03-25 07:12:08 UTC\n\nSorry, changing this behaviour would break loads of applications.\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 04:49:07", "user": 789801, "id": 1171442}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171443", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Greg Hazel** - 2011-03-25 07:38:47 UTC\n\nNo, it wouldn't.

Some of our tables had the primary key column \"id\" set to SMALLINT (http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/numeric-types.html) to save a little disk space. The problem is that the ids generated by Fixtures::identify are too long - they don't take the length of the target column into account, being just a modulo'd hash of the name.\n\nThis is on Rails 2.3.11.\n\nThe question is, is this something warranting attention ?\nI'd like to go and try to make a test and a fix for this, as I consider this a bug - the magic fixtures should be magic enough to work on smaller columns.\n\nBut will a solution, which might make the Fixture system more complicated, be accepted ?

On PostgreSQL it will contain NULL. \n\n``` ruby\n  Receivable.first.arrears => nil\n```\n\nThis seems a little inconsistent to me so I've written a patch, tested against 2-3-stable and PostgreSQL 9.0.3. It does the add column in one query which is consistent with the other two adaptors mentioned. \n\nPerhaps this consistency is not required, but it's been a bit of a headache migrating from these two databases to postgresql because of it. \n\nOf note: this way is slower, as now add_column needs to write all the default values for the table. If you need the old behaviour simply break out the add column and default:\n\n``` ruby\n  add_column :receivables, :arrears, :boolean\n  change_column_default :receivables, :arrears, false\n```\n", "labels": [], "number": 978, "updated_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:37", "user": 789801, "closed_at": "2011-05-21 15:12:37", "id": 904900, "title": "PostgreSQL add column behaves differently to other adaptors (SQlite, MySQL) when specifying default", "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/978", "created_at": "2011-05-16 05:30:27", "comments": [{"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171550", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **Michael Granger** - 2011-04-19 14:28:33 UTC\n\nI'm not sure why your migrations aren't doing this, but PostgreSQL does set the default values on new columns in an ALTER TABLE:\n\n``` sql\n    $ psql test\n    psql (9.0.3)\n    Type \"help\" for help.\n\n    test=> create table foo ( id serial, name text );\n    NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence \"foo_id_seq\" for serial column \"foo.id\"\n    CREATE TABLE\n    test=> copy foo (name) from stdin;\n    Enter data to be copied followed by a newline.\n    End with a backslash and a period on a line by itself.\n    >> Tricky  \n    >> Dicky\n    >> Ricky\n    >> Micky\n    >> Maude\n    >> \\.\n    test=> select * from foo;\n     id |  name  \n    ----+--------\n      1 | Tricky\n      2 | Dicky\n      3 | Ricky\n      4 | Micky\n      5 | Maude\n    (5 rows)\n\n    test=> alter table foo add column signed boolean default false;\n    ALTER TABLE\n    test=> select * from foo;\n     id |  name  | signed \n    ----+--------+--------\n      1 | Tricky | f\n      2 | Dicky  | f\n      3 | Ricky  | f\n      4 | Micky  | f\n      5 | Maude  | f\n    (5 rows)\n\n```\n", "created_at": "2011-05-16 05:30:28", "user": 789801, "id": 1171550}, {"reactions": {}, "url": "https://api.github.com/repos/rails/rails/issues/comments/1171551", "text": "_Imported from Lighthouse._\nComment by **John Barker** - 2011-04-23 10:16:42 UTC\n\nRails actually sends separate commands to the database when you do an add_column, not a single alter table statement.
